See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells (vari -ous Relief , Healing , and Healing True spells).

1. Diagnostics - Caster taps into the mind of a target to diagnose the target's wounds, injuries, and diseases allowing a +25 bonus to all Medicine maneuvers made by the caster to treat the target's diagnosed condition(s). Caster can take a round to advise someone else on treating the target, providing a +15 bonus to treat the target.

2.  Transference -  Caster  transfers  one  injury,  wound,  state  of death,  soul  departure  (not  soul  destruction),  disease,  or  poison from the target to himself. With an Easy Spell Mastery maneuver, the caster may elect to only transfer certain components of an in -jury to himself, but he cannot break up an individual component of the injury (e.g., if an injury has done 18 hits, a round of Stun (-50), 2 hits/round of bleeding, and inflicted a -30 penalty, the cast -er might elect to transfer the Stun or bleeding as the most urgent components, and leave the target with 18 hits of damage and a -30 penalty; the caster could not, however, choose to only transfer 12 of the hits or 1 hit/round of bleeding, or -20 worth of penalty). The caster immediately suffers all effects transferred, while the target is immediately and completely cured of all such effects. However, if  the caster would be killed by the transferred damage, they go into a coma and death is delayed for one minute (during which time  subconscious  healing  spells  may  be  cast  to  prevent  death from occurring at all).

3.  Psychotransference -  Caster  transfers  one  mental  illness  or addiction from the target to himself.

4. Detoxification - One poison or disease is totally removed from the caster's system. This does not undo any damage already done by the poison or disease, which must be cured separately.

5. Long Diagnostics - As Diagnostics , except for range.

6. Lose Addiction I - Caster cleanses his system of one addiction. There  is  a  recovery  period  of  1-10  weeks  during  which  minor withdrawal symptoms will cause the caster a -10 penalty to all actions.

7. Transfer Curse - Caster transfers one curse from the target to himself.

8. Instant Transference * - As Transference , except that it this is an instantaneous spell.

9. Curse Cure - [RR Mod.: -10] Caster rids himself of one curse. If the curse makes its RR, the caster cannot try again to remove it until he has gained a rank in this list. (Note that if the caster has a different curse removal spell from a different list, then he does get a second chance with that spell.)

10. Mind Disease Cures - Caster is cured of one mental illness or malady. This will require a 1-10 day recovery period to take effect.

11. Long Transference - As Transference , except for range.

12. Alter Transference - For the caster's next Transference spell, cast within one round/level of casting this spell, he may instead transfer the affliction to another (willing) target with a range of touch.

13. Suspend Life - Caster may suspend all life functions from his body, effectively entering suspended animation for the duration of the spell or until a fixed specified time has passed or a specified triggering event occurs (e.g., body brought to a specific person). While suspended the caster does not age, require food, water, or air, nor will any herbs work on his body although healing spells may continue to be used, but no further harm will come to him from any injury, toxin, curse, etc. until life resumes. The caster is not protected from further harm by external causes.

14. Mass Diagnostics - As Diagnostics , except each round caster may target any one individual within range of this spell.

15. Transference True - Caster may transfer any number of afflictions from 1 target.

16. Lose Addiction II - Caster cleanses his system of one addic -tion. There is a recovery period of 1-10 days during which minor withdrawal symptoms will cause the caster a -10 penalty to all actions.

17. Complete Detoxification - All poisons and diseases are totally removed from the caster's system. This does not undo any damage already done by a poison or disease, which must be cured separately.

18. Mind Disease Cures True - Caster is instantly cured of one mental illness or malady.

19. Suspend Life True - As Suspend Life , except for duration.

20. Curse Cure True - [RR Mod.: -50] As Curse Cure ,  except curse's RR is at a -50 penalty.

25. Lose Addiction True - Caster cleanses his system of one ad -diction. There  is  a  recovery  period  of  1-10  hours  during  which minor withdrawal symptoms will cause the caster a -10 penalty to all actions.

30. Mass Transference - Caster may transfer up to 1 condition/ level to himself from any number of targets within range. A con -dition  in  this  context  is  a  wound,  injury,  disease,  poison,  curse, mental illness, or addiction.

35. Transfer Possession - Caster transfers one possessing demon, spirit, soul, or like entitity from the target to himself.

40. Expel Intruder - [RR Mod.: -35] Caster expels one possess -ing demon, spirit, soul, or like entity from his person. If this fails, the  caster  cannot  cast  this  spell  again  for  1-10  days,  though  he will get whatever normal RRs may be allowed to resist/expel the possessing entity.

50. Transference Mastery - Caster may use 1 spell from this list per round.

Note : See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells  (various Relief , Healing ,  and Healing  True spells). While medical treatment of the wound is miraculously im -mediate, the body will still need a period of recovery before the injury has healed, depending on several factors, including which type of wound-healing spell is used.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1.  Light  Organ  Relief - An  injury  to  an  organ  (e.g.  eye, ear, liver, but not the brain or nerves) incurring a penalty up to  20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, and the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll.
2.  Medium Organ Relief - As Light Organ Relief ,  but  an injury incurring a penalty up to -40. This can be used to cure most causes of infertility (if the requisite organs are still pres -ent).
3. Severe Organ Relief - As Light Organ Relief , but an inju -ry incurring any penalty.
4. Restart Heart - Caster's heart will start beating after hav -ing stopped. This does not repair any heart disease or damage that caused the initial stoppage.
5. Sense Restoration - Caster regains function in one sensory organ, so long as that sensory organ has not been completely destroyed (in which case Organ Regeneration is  required). The recovery time is 1-10 hours.
6. Light Organ Healing - As Light Organ Relief , except the recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
7.  Joining ‡ * - Caster can reattach 1 severed limb; it re -quires the use of the other 3 Healer Joining spells in order to make limb fully functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.
8. End Coma - Caster comes out of a coma or unconsciousness caused by injury, disease, poison, spell, or spell failure.
9. Medium Organ Healing - As Medium Organ Relief , ex -cept the recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
10. Sense Restoration True - As Sense Restoration , except recovery is instantaneous.
11. Severe Organ Healing - As Severe Organ Relief , except the recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
12. Paralysis Cures - Removes any paralysis problem suffered by the caster. The recovery time is 1-10 days. Treat as -100 injury for progress of recovery.
13. Light Organ Healing True - As Light Organ Relief , ex -cept the recovery time is reduced to rounds rather than days.
14. Light Nerve Healing - As Light Organ Relief , except an injury to nerves incurring a penalty up to -20, and the recov -ery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
15. Joining True ‡ * - As Joining , except caster must cast the other 3 Healer Joining True spells and recovery is instantaneous.
16. Medium Organ Healing True - As Medium Organ Relief , except the recovery time is reduced to rounds rather than days.
17. Medium Nerve Healing - As Light Nerve Healing , ex -cept an injury to nerves incurring a penalty up to -40.
18. Severe Organ Healing True - As Severe Organ Relief , except  the  recovery  time  is  reduced  to  rounds  rather  than days.
19. Severe Nerve Healing - As Light Nerve Healing , except an injury to nerves incurring any penalty.
20.  Brain  Repair -  Caster  can  repair  brain  damage  (such as  that  caused  by  a  skull  fracture,  etc.  at  the  discretion  of the GM). Recovery time is 1-10 hours. This includes damage from the Mind Death spell list.
25. Organ Regeneration - Caster can regenerate any 1 or -gan (external or internal), except the brain. The recovery time is 1-10 hours.
30. Regrow Limb ‡ * - Caster can regrow 1 lost limb; re -quires use of the other 3 Healer Regrow Limb spells in order to make limb fully functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.
35. Paralysis Cures True - As Paralysis Cures , except re -covery is instantaneous.
40. Instant Brain Repair - As Brain Repair , except instant -ly provides complete recovery, taking data stored in caster's or original victim's aura to reconstruct the brain exactly.
50. Reuniting - Caster may reunite his soul with his body, provided the latter is functional. To restore a dead target to life, a Healer would first have to heal all of the latter's wounds (without 'killing' himself) and then restore the target's soul by giving up his own (for the target this process operates like the 19th level Lifegiving II spell on the Cleric Base list, Life Mastery). While technically alive, but without his soul, the Healer would be affected as if he had been 'absolved' (see Cleric Base list, Channels); thus, he could take no conscious actions and he would be at -75 for all subconscious actions. The caster may regain his own soul through the use of this spell (which does not suffer the -75 penalty) or through some -one else casting an appropriate spell.

1. Distraction - Target is at -30 for all actions.

2. Confusion - Target is incapable of making decisions or initiat -ing action, but may continue to fight current foes or in self-defense. The target may also follow orders from the target's leader (if any), but  will  only  be  able  to  follow  them  so  long  as  no  ambiguities arise.

3. Blur Vision - Target has a -100 OB modification for missile attacks and a -50 penalty for all other actions involving sight.

4. Fear - Target fears caster and attempts to flee. (This does not involve a Fear RR or the usual fear mechanics. Use a normal Es -sence or Mentalism RR and the result is flight for the specified duration.)

5. Stumble - Target becomes unbalanced. If the target is moving, the target trips and falls (prone and stunned (-50) for 1-5 rounds); any maneuver that the target was performing when affected by this spell automatically fails.

6. Fumble - As Stumble , except target also fumbles any weapon or item currently held; roll on the appropriate RMCL Chapter 11 Fumble Table.

7. Hallucination - Target sees a nonexistent foe and must fight this foe until it is 'defeated' (i.e., takes damage that would drop the target). Foe has same capabilities as target but does no damage (i.e., always misses).

8. Spin - Target is spun about a few times, ending up facing 180° away from his original facing, then spends the rest of the round recovering from the disorientation.

9. Weapon Alteration - Target perceives the target's weapon(s) as changed into some other similar weapon(s), which lacks the right balance even if familiar to the target. Target will only have half normal OB with the weapon(s) so long as this delusion remains in effect.

10. Mirages - Target sees all moving things clearly, but the caster can control the fixed scene that the target 'sees'.

11. Blinding - Target is blinded.

12. Shifting Sight - Target sees moving things shifted between 6" and 18" from where they really are; any attack the target makes against a moving foe has a 50% chance of having no effect.

13. Mass Distraction - A number of targets equal to the caster's level can be distracted as in Distraction ;  they must all be in the caster's field of vision.

14. Word of Fear * - As Fear , except the spell is instantaneous and the duration is 1 minute per 5 failure.

15. Amnesia - Target has amnesia, but loses no skills or abilities. This is a loss of personal memories and knowledge of own identity and background.

16. Shout of Confusion * - As Confusion , except the spell is in -stantaneous and all beings (other than the caster) within an area encompassed by a radius of 50' are targets.

17. Long Bewilderment - As any single spell from this list of no more than 10th level, except the range is increased to 300'.

18. Shout of Fear * - As Fear , except the spell is instantaneous and the duration is 1 minute per 5 failure and all beings (other than the caster) within a fifty foot radius are targets.

19.  Rebellious  Weapon - As Weapon Alteratio n,  except  target must also make an RR each round or fumble his weapon. If the target is using two weapons, he must make a separate RR for each weapon and may fumble twice in a round due to the spell. He may still fumble normally if he gets to make an attack.

20. Lord Bewilderment - As any single spell from this list of no more than 10th level, except affects up to 20 targets.

25. Amnesia True - As Amnesia ,  except  duration is  permanent (unless dispelled).

30. Parallel Reality - Target sees and hears a world in which ev -erything real has an image, but the image is changed or distorted (e.g., a Dwarf might seem to be an Elf, a house might seem to be a cave, etc.).

35.  Shout  of Amnesia  * - As Amnesia ,  except  the  spell  is  in -stantaneous and all beings (other than the caster) within an area encompassed by a radius of 50' are targets.

40. Mass Long Bewilderment - As any single spell from this list of no more than 10th level, except the range is increased to 300' and it affects up to one target per level of the caster.

50. Bewilderment True - As any single spell from this list of no more than 20th level, except affects up to one target per level of the caster and the range is 300'.

Note : All vacuums created by the spells on this list also create a loud noise. The larger the radius the louder the noise. The GM may wish to rule that all within the radius must make a second RR or be deafened for 1 round per 10 failure (RR attack level equals the radius of the vacuum).

Note :  An  elemental  creature  made  of  gas  will  be  reduced  to  1 AP per round if successfully attacked with an Air Stop spell (the creature must fit into the area of effect). A Vacuum thrown at a creature made of gas will result in a Slaying IV Critical on the creature. A Whirling Winds has no effect on an elemental creature made of gas, though creatures shape-changed into gas are affected normally.

  

1.  Condensation -  Condenses  1  cubic  foot  of  water  from  the surrounding air. Condensation can be channeled into any suitable receptacle, including caster's cupped hands.

2. Airwall - Creates a wall of dense churning air up to 10'x10'x3'. This  wall  requires  1  AP  to  cross,  the  pace  of  anyone  moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by one (e.g, a Run going in would be a Jog coming out), and attacks through the wall suffer a -50 penalty. See Section 10.20 for addi -tional details on Wall spells.

3. Thick Fog II - Creates very dense fog in a 20' radius; normal visibility is 1'.

4. Vacuum A - Creates a near vacuum with a five foot radius; all within this radius take an A Impact critical (if they fail an RR), as air leaves and rushes back in.

5. Air Stop I - Stops all generalized air movement up to winds of 30 mph and cuts higher winds by 30 mph in a 10' radius.

6. Thick Fog X - As Thick Fog II , except radius is 100'.

7. Airwall True - As Airwall , except has a set duration of 1 min/ level and does not require concentration.

8. Bolt of Fire I - A bolt of fire is shot from a fire source within 20'  of  the  caster;  results  are  determined  on  the  Fire  Bolt Table. Range modifier is based on the distance from the fire source to the bolt's target.

9. Vacuum B - As Vacuum A , except results in a B Impact critical.

10. Air Stop V - As Air Stop I , except radius is 50'.

11. Thick Fog XXX - As Thick Fog II , except radius is 300'.

12. Gas/Air - All gas within 10' of caster is converted to breath -able air.

13. Vacuum C - As Vacuum A , except results in a C Impact crit -ical.

14. Oxygenation - Enriches a 50' radius of air with extra oxygen; within this radius all animal life receives a +20 bonus to their OBs and fire attacks deliver double the normal number of hits.

15. Whirling Winds - Creates a whirlwind about caster; it moves with the caster and has a 10'R. No missile attacks can penetrate it and any movement (except for caster's) into the whirlwind costs 2 AP and slows movement to a Walk pace, melee or elemental attacks on the caster through the whirlwind suffer a -50 penalty to OB.

16. Bolt of Fire III - As Bolt of Fire I ,  except range increment is 75'.

17. Vacuum D - As Vacuum A , except causes a D Impact critical.

18. Greater Vacuum B - As Vacuum B , except radius is 10'.

19. Reverse Wind - Allows the caster to change the direction of the wind within the radius.

20. Thick Fog True - As Thick Fog II , except duration is 1 hour per level and the radius is 100' per level.

25. Vacuum E - As Vacuum A , except causes an E Impact critical.

30. Cloud Mastery - Caster has complete control of clouds within area  of  effect  (includes  fog);  storm  clouds  can  be  gathered  and made to rain (or snow or hail in suitable conditions), but they can -not be created.

35. Greater Vacuum E - As Vacuum E , except radius is 10'.

40. Toxic Cloud - Creates a cloud of toxic gas. Any living thing coming within the cloud must make an RR versus poison each round or suffer a cumulative -10 penalty and take 2d10 damage from  the  effects  of  the  gas.  Treat  the  penalty  as  organ  damage (lungs) for treatment/healing purposes and the final penalty as a single injury. Level of the poison is the level of the caster. The cloud takes one round to form, but the gas is barely visible (Very Hard Perception maneuver to notice by sight). Those in the cloud during the formation round will have their breathing irritated but suffer no damage if they leave the cloud before the next round.

50. Gas Transmutation - May transmute 1,000 cubic feet of gas (no part can be more than 20' away) into another non-magical gas that the caster has a sample of. This transmutation requires eight hours of uninterrupted work.

Note : For guidelines on handling invisibility, see Section 10.11.

  

1. Blur * - Causes caster to appear blurred to attackers, granting a +10 to the caster's DB.

2. Unseen I - A single object is made invisible (1 garment, 1 naked body, etc.); until 24 hrs pass or target is struck by a violent blow (being hit by a weapon, falling, etc.) or target makes a violent move (i.e., an attack) or target casts a spell of type E or F.

3.  Shadow -  Caster  and  objects  on  the  caster's  person  appear  to  be  in shadow and thus are almost invisible in dark areas (in many situations this could be handled with a Stalking bonus of between +25 and +75).

4. Quiet I - Creates a 1'R area into and out of which sound cannot travel. As explained in Section 10.17, this spell can be cast on an individual target, which the spell will then follow; this target gains +25 to Stalking attempts, but likewise automatically fails any Perception attempts based on hearing alone and suffers a -50 to Perception rolls where hearing is a factor (e.g., to  detect  someone Stalking the target). Note that this does not interfere with spell-casting (the target can still speak, even yell, the sound is simply unable to leave the radius of the Quiet - certain spells like Ultrasonics may have their range limited to the interior of the Quiet radius, however).

5. Resilient Invisibility I - As Unseen I , except everything within 1' of the target is invisible as long as it is within the 1'R and none of the Unseen I termination conditions occur. The first time an Unseen I termination condition occurs, the target will become visible for one round and then become invisible again. If an Unseen I condition happens again, the spell ends. A target rendered invisible by this spell therefore can make one violent move (an attack) or cast one spell of type E or F or be struck once by a violent blow without losing the invisibility.

6. Resilient Invisibility II - As Resilient Invisibility I ,  except the caster can vary the radius up to 1'. This makes the invisible target harder to see by reducing the 'fringe effect'.

7. Screens - Creates a 1,000 square foot screen on which the caster can place any static scene; this scene seems 3-dimensional and normal.

<!-- image -->

8. Displacement I - Caster's apparent location is offset from the actual location; all attacks have no effect 10% of the time. Each time a foe misses due to this effect, the chance of that foe missing again goes down 5%.

9. No Sense - As Resilient Invisibility I , except target is also undetectable by smell and sound.

10. Shadow Mystic - Creates a duplicate of the caster; if the caster con -centrates, it will move as willed; otherwise, it does exactly as the caster does. The duplicate cannot move more than 100' away from the caster. If the caster concentrates, he can 'merge' the duplicate with himself and then split back apart again (making it difficult to discern which one is the 'real' caster).

11. Resilient Invisibility Sphere I - As Resilient Invisibility I , except the constant radius is 10'. Note that anything that exits the radius will become visible again.

12. Displacement II - As Displacement I , except base chance of missing is 20%.

13. Flattening - Caster is flattened until becoming virtually two-dimen -sional. This allows the caster to slide through cracks and makes the caster effectively invisible when viewed from the side.

14. Merging - Caster can merge into any solid, inanimate material. While merged, the caster cannot move, perceive, or cast spells. When the caster emerges from the material, it is possible to emerge from any side or face of the material, although this is limited to moving 'through' no more than the caster's own body size plus two feet worth of material. The caster can exit at any time up to the end of spell duration (at which time the caster automatically emerges at the entrance point).

15. Greater Resilient Invisibility - As Resilient Invisibility II , except the invisibility can survive (level/5) termination actions. For example, if cast by a 15th level caster, the invisibility will survive three (15/5) termina -tion events, e.g. a total of three violent moves, spell casting attempts or being struck violently, thus the caster could make an attack, be hit by an opponent, and cast a spell without losing the invisibility, but if the caster made another attack or cast another E or F spell or suffered another hit, the invisibility would end .

16. Displacement III - As Displacement I , except base chance of missing is 30%.

17. Passing - Caster may pass through any inanimate material up to 1 foot/ level. It takes 1 round to pass through 2 feet of material.

18. Mystic Manner - Caster's actions are extremely subtle for the duration of this spell. Any form of non-magical detection or observation regarding the Mystic and his activities suffers a -50 penalty. The caster also may hide spell-casting without the normal Subtlety penalty to his spell-casting roll (and the -50 is applied to attempts to detect this casting as well).

19. Great Merge - As Merging , except caster can turn within the material and can perceive the outside world if within 6" of the surface.

20. Displacement IV - As Displacement I , except base chance of missing is 40%.

25. Nondetect - Caster and objects on his person cannot be detected by any ' Detect ...' spells.

30. Displacement V - As Displacement I , except base chance of missing is 50%.

35.  Dimensional  Closet -  Caster  disappears  into  a  private  world.  This place is largely featureless, but by concentrating, the caster can view (and listen) from the point of departure. The caster may also create any material objects desired, although anything not consumed by the caster will disap -pear upon leaving the dimensional closet (so the caster may eat, drink, take an antidote to a poison, etc., but cannot arm himself or emerge with great wealth). The caster will reappear in the same place when the duration of the spell expires or when the caster chooses to cancel the spell. If the point of departure is now occupied, the caster will be teleported D10x100 feet in a random direction.

40. Displacement VI - As Displacement I , except base chance of missing is 60%.

50. Hiding True - Caster can 'Merge' into a material and may observe surrounding activity, and is affected by Unpresence , Nondetect , and Greater Resilient Invisibility all with this one spell.

1. Boil/Freeze Liquid - The caster may alter the temperature of any inanimate body of liquid of up to 1 cubic foot per level by 50°F [28°C] per round of concentration. Once the liquid begins to boil or freeze, it will not continue to change temperature, but will begin to warm or cool naturally if the caster stops concentrating. Caster is immune to the heat/cold thus generated.

2. Clear/Desalinate Liquid - Removes all sediment and dissolved substances from a liquid.

3. Evaporate Liquid - All targeted liquid (up to a maximum of 1000  cubic  feet  per  level)  is  evaporated  (i.e.,  boiled  away  and turned into heated gas) at a rate of one hundred cubic feet of liquid per round of concentration.

4. Waterwall - Creates a wall of water up to 10'x10'x1'. This wall requires 2 AP to cross, the pace of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by two (e.g, a Run going in would be a Walk pace coming out) to a minimum of a Walk, and attacks through the wall suffer a -80 penalty. See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

5. Bolt of Water I - A bolt of water is shot from a water source within 20' of the caster; results are determined on the Water Bolt Table.  Range  modifier  is  based  on  the  distance  from  the  water source to the bolt's target.

6. Water Corridor I - Creates a corridor through liquid up to 100' long, 3' wide, and 10' deep (must be open at the top).

7. Call Rain - If there are clouds in the sky, it rains outdoors for the duration of the spell.

8. Calm Water - All water within a 100'R is calmed; waves are cut by 20' in the center and less towards the perimeter. This will negate the effects of currents in the area of effect.

9. Wave - Creates a wave moving away from the caster; wave is 1' high per level in the center and 10' per level wide.

10. Waterwall True - As Waterwall , except caster need not con -centrate and the duration is 1 minute per level.

11. Water Corridor III - As Water Corridor I ,  except  limit  is 300'x4'x50' deep.

12. Liquid/Water - Changes any liquid into fresh water.

13. Lesser Whirlpool - Creates a whirlpool with a 20 foot radius in any liquid body that will draw in any objects in the liquid up to 200' away. Objects capable of moving under their own power may make a Very Hard maneuver to resist the pull of the whirlpool.

14. Water Tunnel - Creates a tunnel through liquid that is 5' in diameter and 100' long.

15. Calm Water True - As Calm Water ,  except  radius  is  100'/ lvl and waves are cut by 50' in the center and caster need not con -centrate.

16. Command Current - The area of effect for this spell is the water  immediately  surrounding  the  boat  that  the  caster  is  on (where 'boat' should be interpreted loosely; a log is a 'boat' for purposes of this spell if the caster is riding it on water). For as long as the caster concentrates, the speed of the boat will be increased by 25' per round (approximately 3 miles per hour).

17.  Water  Bubble -  Creates  a  bubble  of  air  (10'R)  around  the caster  and  others,  which  will  carry  them  in  up  to  100'  depth  of water (air is replenished). Caster can direct the motion of the bub -ble at a rate of 30'/round (may be adjusted by the presence of (un) favorable water currents. If/when the caster stops concentrating, the bubble will rise to the surface at the same rate (30'/round). If the caster resumes concentrating before the bubble surfaces, the bubble may be controlled again. All objects inside the bubble will rise with it.

40. Command Rain - As Call Rain , except for area of effect and duration.

  

1. Study Individual - Caster studies and memorizes the appear -ance  and  mannerisms  of  a  being,  for  later  use  with  higher  lev -el  spells  on  this  list. The  caster  must  observe the target for five minutes after casting the spell in order to complete the study. The caster can only have as many forms studied as he has ranks in this list.  Caster  may  choose  to  forget  a  studied  form  at  any  time  to make room for replacements.

2. Face Shifting True - Allows caster to alter the form of his face. He can take on the exact face of another being if he has used Study Individual on the being he wishes to copy.

3. Minor Changing - Caster can alter his own form to the form of any desired humanoid race within his own Size category. The form can be that of a particular individual that has been the target of Study Individual ; this does not include mannerisms, but only ap -pearance. Note that only the physical form is gained (i.e., a target that becomes a Dwarf would not receive a Dwarf's ability to see in the dark). Non-magical clothing will refit itself to the new form, but other equipment will not change, with the exception of pros -thetics added by means of the Lay Healer Base list Prosthetics.

4. Misfeel Kind · * - For the purposes of mental or magical de -tections, caster appears to be of any race with which the caster is familiar.

5. Deceptive Aura - [RR Mod.: -50] Caster fools a magic item into reacting to the caster as if the caster were of another race, sex, Profession, religion, etc. in order to make use (or better use) of the item. This does not allow the caster to use a PP multiplier or Spell Adder for a realm he does not actually use, although it will allow use of a PP multiplier that works for only one of his realms.

6. Major Changing - As Minor Changing , except form need not be humanoid, but must be a living organic thing.

<!-- image -->

7. Misfeel Calling · * - As Misfeel Kind , except caster's profes -sion may be misrepresented.

8. Changing Lungs - Caster can breathe water, air, or any gas at will.

9. Shrinking Change - As Minor Changing , except form may be one Size category smaller than the caster's.

10. Mystical Tongue - [RR Mod: -50] Caster can speak mentally with any sentient target, and to the target, it will seem as if the caster was speaking in the target's primary language.

11. Misfeel Power · * - As Misfeel Kind , except caster's level may be misrepresented (to an upper limit of twice the caster's actual level).

12. Impersonation - As Major Changing , except a specific being who has been the target of Study Individual can be duplicated in both appearance and mannerisms.

13. Unpresence Self - Caster becomes undetectable by Presence spells or related abilities.
14. Misfeel · * - Allows caster to use all of the 'Misfeel' spells at once.
15. Changing True - As Major Changing , except caster can alter forms at will, by concentrating for one round/change.

16. Growing Change - As Minor Changing , except form may be one Size category larger than the caster's.

17. Impersonation True - As Impersonation ,  except caster can alter forms at will, by concentrating for one round/change.

18.  Long  Major  Changing -  As Major  Changing ,  except  for duration.

19. Long Impersonation - As Impersonation , except for duration.

20. Unpresence True - As Unpresence Self ,  except caster does not have to concentrate.

25. Misfeel True · - As Misfeel , except it has a ten minute/level duration and does not require concentration.

30. Holy Presence - As Misfeel ,  except caster can misrepresent his presence and power, so that he seems to be a minor deity. Even those viewing with normal senses will be given an impression of superhuman power and majesty.

35. Shapechanging - Caster can alter his own form to the form of any desired living thing. The form can be that of a particular indi -vidual that has been the target of Study Individual , in which case the caster may have the mannerisms of that individual as well. The caster gains all natural abilities of the form taken, but not magical abilities. Non-magical clothing will change form to fit the caster's new body, or may join the rest of items worn or carried, which merge into the caster's body for the duration of the spell. If the caster dies, the spell immediately ends.

40. Shapechanging True - As Shapechanging , except caster can alter forms at will, by concentrating for one round/change.

50. Submerge Self - Caster develops an entire false persona and places his own persona deep in his subconscious. To all detection attempts (except, perhaps, Mind Probe ), the caster seems to be the false persona. The caster has no control over his actions (except for  having designed the persona now in control), until the spell ends. The false persona can be a specific individual if Study Individual has been cast once/day (for 30 days) on that individual. The caster must determine a set period after which the spell will end and may also specify one triggering event that can cancel the spell before that period expires. The caster will remember everything that happened while the false persona was in control.

1. Enchanted Rope - If the caster holds one end of a rope, he can cause the rope to move up to its length in any di -rection and to tie itself in knots (it cannot attack or tie up a living being).

2. Heat Solid I - Warms 1 cubic foot of any solid, inani -mate material per level up to 500°F (260°C) at a rate of 1 cubic foot heated by 100°F (56°C) per round of concentra -tion (without concentration, the material will remain at its current temperature for the remainder of the duration). The caster is immune to this heat.

3.  Cool Solid - Any solid, inanimate, non-metal material can be cooled to -20°F (-29°C), at a rate of 1 cubic foot per round (cooling spreads evenly from initial point of cooling unless caster concentrates to direct spread).

4. Cracks Call - Any previous cracks or flaws in material up to 10'x10'x10' section will extend to their limit.

5. Door - Can cause a door to expand or contract due to subtle temperature changes; door can be jammed or loos -ened (a special modification of +/- 50 to maneuvers to force the door can be granted).

6.  Woodfires -  Causes  any  wood  to  ignite  and  burn. All wood ignited must be within 1' of caster's palm.

7. Strengthen Material - Causes any one object of up to 1 cubic foot per level of the caster to be much more resistant to damage. It will resist destructive spells as if the RR was being made by the caster and it will have a +50 bonus to any normal rolls against breakage.

8. Heat Solid II - As Heat Solid I , except the range is 50'.

9. Chill Other Solid - Any solid, inanimate, non-metal ma -terial can be cooled to -200°F (-129°C), at a rate of (1 cubic foot and -100°F/56°C)/round. The caster must concentrate to decrease the temperature (without concentration, the ma -terial will retain its current temperature for the duration of the spell).

10. Wall of Ice - Creates a wall of ice up to 10'x10'x (2' at base, 1' at top); it can be melted through or chipped through or toppled if not against a wall. Requires a source of water or ice within 10'. See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

11. Solid Door I - Creates a doorway through any solid, inanimate material; it can be up to 3'x6'x1'.

12. Stone/Earth/Mud - Will turn 100 cubic feet of stone to packed earth, 100 cubic feet of earth to mud, 100 cubic feet of mud to earth, or 100 cubic feet of earth to stone. The transformation takes 3 rounds to complete.

13. Shatter - Causes a non-metal, inanimate object to shat -ter (up to 1 cubic foot in size). All within 5' radius take an A Impact critical; anyone holding the object takes a C Impact critical.

14. Solid Door II - As Solid Door I , except size is 4'x8'x5'

15. Mold Solid - Caster's hands can mold up to one cubic foot of any solid, inanimate material as if it were putty or clay. The material hardens to normal consistency when the caster is finished. Quality of results depends on caster's skill and time invested.

16. Break Solid - One cubic foot of any solid, inanimate material  becomes  very  brittle.  This  causes  the  object  to break if struck (the GM may rule that certain objects get an RR to resist breakage).

17. Unstone - Disintegrates (i.e., destroys without a resi -due) a target of up to 100 cubic feet of stone.

18. Strengthen Material True - As Strengthen Material , except object can be up to 100 cubic feet per level in size.

19. Unmetal - Disintegrates 1 cubic foot of metal.

20. Solid Tunnel - Creates a tunnel through solid, inani -mate material that is 4' in diameter and 5'/level long.

25.  Solid  Door  True -  As Solid  Door ,  except  size  is 6'x12'x10'.

30. Solid Tunnel True - As Solid Tunnel , except that it is permanent and size is 3'x6'x (1'/level).

35. Mold Solid True - As Mold Solid ,  but  working on a larger scale, suitable for monuments, architectural compo -nents, etc.

40. Living Forge - Caster becomes able to work non-magical metals with his bare hands, needing no other tools to give it the shape and qualities desired (gaining a +20 to any appropriate maneuvers rolled). This includes being able to create alloys if the necessary components are available. If this spell is used in conjunction with proper equipment, a +35 bonus may be gained to appropriate maneuvers.

50. Solid Transmutation - Transmutes up to 1 ounce of any solid material into another non-magical solid material that the caster has a sample of. This transmutation requires eight hours of uninterrupted work.

Note :  For  non-humanoid  targets,  the  GM  may  need  to  use some judgment regarding 'limb' spells. A Limb Pain spell that affects a wing would prevent flight, for example.

  

1. Sprain Limb - A random part of a random limb is sprained. If it is part of a leg: movement is cut by 25%, combat is at -10. If it is part of an arm, combat is modified by -20.

2. Limb Pain - A random limb is in intense pain. If it is a leg, the target cannot walk (target may crawl at 10% of walking movement rate). If it is an arm, that arm cannot be used.

3. Touch of Disruption - The bones and tissues of the target's body are disrupted as if the target had fallen a long distance. If the target's RR fails by 1-10, the target takes an A Impact crit -ical; increase the severity of the critical for each 10 by which the RR is failed (i.e. 11-20 = B, 21-30 = C, 31-40 = D, 41+ = E).

4. Lock Joint - One of the target's joints locks. Target suffers as in Limb Pain , and in addition a moving target that is afflicted with leg lock will fall down; if a target with arm lock is carry -ing anything, it is dropped.

5. Break Limb - A random limb is broken. A broken arm incurs a -40 penalty, while a broken leg results in -25 and move -ment is reduced by 50%.

6. Disruption II - As Touch of Disruption , except range is 20'.

7.  Skin  Death - Target's skin will flake and peel (on entire body). There is no tactical penalty, but it ruins the appearance of the target, resulting in a -25 to -75 on social interactions, de -pending on the importance of appearance. Lasts until dispelled and 1 month passes (recovery time may be reduced through magical healing).

8. Disruption V - As Touch of Disruption , except range is 50'.

9. Ear Disruption - One of the target's ears (randomly cho -sen) is disrupted. Hearing is at 50% of normal until cured (-25 to Perception involving hearing, -50 to Perception only involv -ing hearing). If both ears go, the target will be rendered deaf.

10.  Limb  Death -  One  of  the  target's  limbs  (random)  will wither and die. Target loses 5% of the use of the limb per day; when the total reaches 100%, the limb falls off. Can be cured through flesh and nerve repair spells suitable for the degree of lost use (e.g., at 25% loss, treat as a -25 injury penalty, thus re -quiring Medium Flesh Relief and Medium Nerve Relief ) before reaching 80%, after which it must be regenerated. If the limb is a leg, movement is reduced by half the percentage lost (e.g., if a leg is 60% withered, movement is cut by 30%). If the limb is an arm, combat suffers a -1 penalty per 2% withered (e.g., if an arm is 80% withered, all combat with that arm will suffer a -40 penalty).

11. Eye Disruption - As Ear Disruption , except an eye is af -fected and the penalties are to Perception involving sight.

12. Collapse Lung - One of the target's lungs collapses. This restricts  the  target  to  half  of  normal  activity  for  all  physical activity (treat as 2 AP per round and half normal BMR) until the lung is repaired.

13. Muscle Death - As Limb Death , except a random muscle is affected (not muscle organs, e.g., not the heart).

14. Bone Death - As Limb Death , except a random bone (not part of spine or skull) gradually disintegrates.

15. Black Channel I - One of the Black Channel I spells may be used (see Section 10.7); the Gamemaster must decide which one(s) may be used on the basis of culture and world system.

16.  Rupture - Target's skin splits and begins to bleed. One bleeding wound opens for every 10 by which the target's RR was failed, with each bleeding 1-5 hits per round (roll random -ly for each wound).

17. Long Flesh Destruction - As one of Sprain Limb , Limb Pain , Lock Joint , Break Limb , Skin Death , or Ear Disruption , except with a range of 300'.

18. Corpse Disposal - Target must be dead; the spell causes a  body  to  decompose  almost  instantaneously,  including  the bones or other hard parts, crumbling into a fertile dust.

19. Mass Flesh Destruction - As any lower level spell other than Disruption or Black Channel spells, except that it may be cast upon as many targets as the caster has levels.

20. Petrifaction - The target's bones will gradually petrify; a loss of activity (as in Limb Death ) occurs due to loss of blood production. Treat the loss of use as a penalty to all physical maneuvers and all Endurance rolls. At 100%, this effect be -comes fatal.

25. Disruption X - As Touch of Disruption ,  except range is 100'.

30. Black Channel II - As Black Channel I , except one of the Black Channel II spells may be used.

35. Disruption True - As Touch of Disruption , except range is 300' and delivers an E Impact critical if the target fails to resist.

40. Multichannels Noir - As Black Channel I , except that it may be cast upon as many targets as the caster has levels.

50. Black Channel III - As Black Channel I , except one of the Black Channel III spells may be used.

1. Vaporize Fluid - Vaporizes 10 cubic feet of liquid/level.

2. Freeze Fluid - Freezes 10 cubic feet of liquid/level.

3. Evaporation I - Causes 1000 cubic feet of liquid to rap -idly evaporate over the course of 1 hour.

4.  Unwater  I -  Instantly  disintegrates  100  cubic  feet  of water.

5. Calm Water - All water within a 100'R is calmed; waves are cut by 20' in the center and less towards the perimeter. This will negate the effects of currents in the area of effect.

6. Water Bolt I - A bolt of water is shot from the palm of the caster; results are determined on the Water Bolt Table.

7. Unrain - No precipitation will occur in the area of effect for the duration of the spell.

8. Dehydrate - Removes all the liquid (usually water) from 1 cubic foot of inanimate material.

9. Evaporation II - As Evaporation I , except 10,000 cubic feet are affected.

10. Unwater II - As Unwater I , except 1,000 cubic feet are affected.

11. Unrain True - As Unrain ,  except affects a 500'/level radius for 1 day/level.

12. Dehydrate True - As Dehydrate , except affects 10 cu -bic feet.

13.  Evaporation  III -  As Evaporation  I ,  except  affects 100,000 cubic feet.

14. Unwater III - As Unwater I , except affects 10,000 cu -bic feet.

15. Calm Water True - As Calm Water ,  except radius is 100'/lvl and waves are cut by 50' in the center and caster need not concentrate.

16. Acidic Bolt I - A bolt of acid is shot from the palm of the  caster;  results  determined  on  the  Fire  Bolt Table,  but replacing Heat criticals with Acid criticals and also doing Impact  criticals  one  severity  level  less  than  the  primary critical.

17. Long Fluid Destruction - As any single spell on this list of no more than 10th level, but with a range of 300', or a 75' range increment in the case of Water Bolt .

18. Blood Destruction - [RR Mod.: -25] This spell takes advantage of any bleeding wounds on a target to draw out and destroy additional blood. Target suffers the equivalent of ten rounds bleeding from his wounds as a result of this spell (e.g., if the target were bleeding at a rate of 3 hits per round, this spell would inflict 30 hits of damage).

19. Desiccation - The target immediately begins to dehy -drate and wither as if in a wind-blown sandy desert. Target is immediately at a -10 penalty to all actions and loses 1% of his total hits. For each round that the caster concentrates, the target takes another -5 penalty and 1% of total hits. If the caster maintains concentration for 10 consecutive rounds, animate targets will be reduced to dried out husks, dying. If the target gets out of range or the caster stops concentrating, there is no further damage, but the penalty and hits loss re -main. The hits can heal normally, but the penalty recovers at a rate of 10 per day, assuming regular hydration. A Cure Disease spell can remove the penalty, once the hit loss is healed.

20. Dehumidify - For every minute that the caster concen -trates, the humidity drops 1% of the original humidity (up to 50%). The humidity will gradually increase at a rate of 5% (of  original  humidity)  per  day  until  the  original  humidity is reached. Note that this change in humidity levels could affect an area's climate (in turn affecting the area's vege -tation).

25. Evaporation True -  As Evaporation I , except 1,000,000 cubic feet can be affected.

30.  Calm  Sea -  As Calm  Water  True ,  except  radius  is 1000'R/level.

35. Acidic Bolt V - As Acidic Bolt I , but with a range in -crement of 125'.

40. Mass Desiccation - As Desiccation , except caster may affect up to one target/level.

50. Dehumidify True - Every minute that the caster con -centrates, the humidity drops 5% of the original humidity (up to 95%). The humidity later increases as per the Dehumidify spell.  Note  that  this  change  in  humidity  levels could affect an area's climate (in turn affecting the area's vegetation).

Note : All vacuums created by the spells on this list also cre -ate a loud noise. The larger the radius the louder the noise. The GM may wish to rule that all within the radius must make a second RR or be deafened for 1 round per 10 failure (RR attack level equals the radius of the vacuum).

An elemental creature made of gas will be reduced to 1 AP per round if successfully attacked with an Air Stop spell (the creature must fit into the area of effect). A Vacuum thrown at a creature made of gas will result in a Slaying IV Critical on the creature.

When the oxygen in an area falls below 50% of normal, anyone in that area must make an RR (attack level is 1) or fall asleep (this RR is modified by -2 for every 1% under 50%). Of course, if the % drops below 10%, suffocation be -comes a danger. All fire spells in an area of low oxygen are modified by -2 (or 2% effectiveness for non-attack spells) for every 1% under 50% of normal oxygen.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1.  Foglessness -  Disperses  all  fog  in  a  10'/level  radius and prevents new fog from forming within that radius for 10 minutes per level. If a fog-creating spell makes its RR against this spell, it can create fog within the area of effect.
2. Air Stop I - Stops all generalized air movement up to winds of 30 mph and cuts higher winds by 30 mph in a 10' radius.
3. Vacuum I - Creates a 5' radius of near vacuum; all within the radius take a B Impact critical as the air leaves and rush -es back in (if they fail an RR).
4. Deoxygenation I - Caster can remove the oxygen in a 10' radius at the rate of 2% of the original oxygen each round.
5. Air Stop II - As Air Stop I , except affects a radius of 20'.
6. Vacuum II - As Vacuum I , except affects a radius of 10'.
7. Deoxygenation II - As Deoxygenation I , except affects a radius of 20'.
8. Gas to Air - Changes any gas to normal, breathable air at a rate of 1 cubic foot per round as long as the caster con -centrates.
9. Air Stop X - As Air Stop I , except affects a radius of 100'.
10. Vacuum IV - As Vacuum I , except affects a radius of 20'.
11. Great Vacuum I - As Vacuum I ,  except delivers a D Impact critical in a 5' radius.
12.  Fast  Deoxygenation I - As Deoxygenation I ,  except removal rate is 5% per round.
13. Deoxygenation V - As Deoxygenation I , except affects a radius of 50'.
14. Great Vacuum II - As Great Vacuum I , except affects a radius of 10'.
15. Fast Deoxygenation II - As Fast Deoxygenation I , ex -cept affects a radius of 20'.
16. Air Stop True - As Air Stop I , except affects a radius of 10'/level.
17. Long Gas Destruction - As any single spell on this list of no more than 10th level, but with a range of 300'.
18. Great Vacuum III - As Great Vacuum I , except affects a radius of 15'.
19. Major Deoxygenation - As Deoxygenation I ,  except affects a radius of 20' and removal rate is 10% per round.
20. Major Vacuum I - [RR Mod.: -10] As Vacuum I , ex -cept delivers an E Impact critical in a 5' radius.
25.  Deoxygenation  True -  As Deoxygenation  I ,  except affects a radius of 20' and removal rate is 20% per round.
30. Major Vacuum II - [RR Mod.: -10] As Major Vacuum I , except affects a 10' radius.
35. Vacuum X - As Vacuum I , except affects a radius of 50'.
40. Major Vacuum IV - [RR Mod.: -10] As Major Vacuum I , except affects a radius of 20'.

50. Implosion - Destroys gases in a single enclosure (usually a building) up to a size of 100'x100'x100' (or 1,000,000 cubic  feet).  The  building  has  a  chance  of  collapsing  (de -pendent  on  construction)  and  everyone  inside  takes  an  E Impact critical from falling debris. The implosion will make a very loud noise. If the building collapses everyone within a distance from the building equal to the building's height takes a C Impact critical from flying debris.

Note : When a target loses experience points, this has noth -ing to do with experience levels. The lost experience points simply means that the character will have to gain that many more before rising to  the  next  level. The  experience  loss may be reversed by healing the brain.

Initiative  penalties  from Disorientation , Unbalance ,  and Falter are not cumulative.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Minor Pain - Causes loss of 25% of target's remaining concussion hits (i.e., those not already taken); these hits are healed when the duration is up, provided target has not died.

2. Jolts III - Target is stunned (-50) for 3 rounds.

3. Disorientation - Target must subtract 25 from all Per -ception maneuvers and subtract 5 from initiative rolls.

4. Unbalance - Target must subtract 25 from all maneuvers involving movement and subtract 5 from initiative rolls.

5. Falter - Target must subtract 25 from all combat rolls and subtract 5 from initiative rolls.

6. Jolts VI - Target is stunned (-50) for 6 rounds.

7. Major Pain - As Minor Pain , except 50% of remaining hits are taken.

8. Forget - Target forgets a period (of up to one minute per level) of the past, as desired by the caster.

9. Word Of Pain * - [RR Mod.: -10] As Major Pain , ex -cept hits must be cured or heal normally.

10. Mind Shock - As As Disorientation, Unbalance, and Falter (all at once), except initiative penalty is 10.

11. Mind Death - Target mind blanks out for a period of 10 minutes each day at random. Target is incapable of activity or thought during this period.

12. Jolts X - Target is stunned (-50) for 10 rounds.

13. Unminding - Target's mind is completely blank for the duration. The target cannot perceive events, time, or activ -ity; when the target's mind does come back, this produces one round of stun (-50) due to reorientation.

14. Mass Disorientation - As Disorientation ,  except  for range, duration, and that it affects a number of targets up to the caster's level.

15. Mind Break - Target is a blathering idiot. The target can be led around, but can take no action.

17. Long Mind Destruction - As any single spell on this list of no more than 10th level, but with a range of 300'.

18.  Mass Falter - As Falter ,  except  affects  a  number  of targets equal to the caster's level.

19. Horror - [RR Mod: -20] Target hallucinates an attack by a creature drawn from the target's worst fears. The target will be attacked each round by the creature (doing real dam -age with a +100 Martial Arts Strikes attack). Regardless of the damage done by the target (to the creature), the creature will only be defeated when the target either loses conscious -ness or makes an RR (one RR each 6 rounds).

20. Lost Experience - Target loses 5% of collected experi -ence (usually experience points).

25. Mass Pain - As Minor Pain , except as many targets as the caster's level are affected, the duration is until healed, and the range is 300'.

35. Mass Mind Shock - As Mind Shock , except as many targets as the caster's level can be affected and the range is 300'.

40. Mass Major Pain - As Major Pain ,  except  as  many targets as the caster's level are affected, the duration is until healed, and the range is 300'.

50.  Mass  Unminding - As Unminding ,  except  as  many targets as the caster's level can be affected and the range is 300'.

Note : Neurosis , Guilt , Paranoia , Unsoul Curse and Chronic Panic are curses, with mental effects. See Section 10.2 for treatment options.

Absolution does not kill the body, so Dark Absolution leaves a living, but soulless body.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Question - Target must answer a single concept question (presuming that the target can understand the question).

2. Possession I - Target is possessed by a Type I Demon; caster has no control over the target or Demon. The Demon will force the target to do random (not necessarily destructive) things. Target gets an RR every other round to attempt to get rid of the Demon.

3. Neurosis - Target has an extreme dislike for any specific thing the caster chooses. Target has a 50% chance (modified by three times Self Discipline stat bonus) of overcoming the neurosis when given a choice (e.g., neurosis concerning horses would mean that every time the target tried to get on or near a horse the target would need to make a roll in order to do so).

4. Guilt - Target experiences chronic guilt over some action in his past. The GM should choose some significant event in the target's past. The target will not perform the same or similar actions again and must take steps to alleviate the guilt (acting to rectify the past wrong or, if that is impossible, similar wrongs).

5. Paranoia - Target will trust no one absolutely. When in a life threat -ening/  dangerous situation,  there  is  a  50%  chance  (modified  by  three times Self Discipline stat bonus) that the target will not trust the protec -tion of others and will act unilaterally for self-preservation.

6.  Possession II - As Possession I ,  except Demon is Type II and the possessed only gets an RR once every minute.

7. Word of Panic * - Target flees in total panic from caster. Fleeing equates to movement away at maximum pace for 1 round per 5 failure of the target's RR.

8. Transferal - Target's 'soul' and the caster's 'soul' are interchanged; the caster can operate at half of his normal activity (double all AP costs as with concentration) while in the body of the target. The target (in the caster's body) is inactive. The caster can cancel the spell at any time (takes  one  round). The  target  can  cancel  the  spell  if  he  makes  a  suc - cessful RR (he gets one every 10 minutes). If either body is killed, both 'souls' are destroyed.

9. Spirit Burn - This spell torments a spirit, typically a conjured being like an elemental or demon. These spirits may be targeted even if in an incorporeal form or if possessing another's body. The GM may wish to include some undead among potential targets. The pain caused by this spell reduces the target to 2 AP per round and the target takes 1 hit per 1 failure on the RR as well. These hits do not return at the end of the spell duration; that aspect of the spell is 'permanent'.

10. Possession III - As Possession I , except Demon is Type III and the possessed target only gets an RR once every 10 minutes.

11. Subjugation - Part of the target's 'soul' is taken and placed in an or -ganic object on the caster's person. The body of the target will act as the caster directs (caster must concentrate).The spell ends when: the caster cancels it or the object is destroyed or the body is more than 100' from caster or the object leaves the caster's person. If the caster is not con -centrating the target may act freely, though at -30 to all activities. While being commanded, the target is aware of all the actions performed, but is helpless to stop them.

12. Unsoul Curse - Part of the target's soul is transferred to a random object somewhere within 100 miles; the target is at -30 to all activities until the spell is dispelled or the target touches the object (which returns the missing piece of soul). The target will always know the direction of the lost 'soul'.

13. Possession IV - As Possession I , except Demon is Type IV and the possessed target only gets an RR once every hour.

14. Shout of Panic * - As Word of Panic , except affects everyone within 20' except the caster.

15. Chronic Panic - [RR Mod.: -10] Target must make an RR against Fear (use the highest level foe or GM's judgment for other perils as level of Fear) at -25 in any personally dangerous situation.

16. Spirit Repulsion - [RR Mod.: +10] As Spirit Burn , except if target fails RR it must retreat to its own plane of existence, if applicable, or it will be transported instantly to its 'home' location on this plane and is reduced to zero hits.

17. Long Soul Destruction - As any single spell on this list of no more than 10th level, but with a range of 300'.

18. Possession V - As Possession I , except Demon is Type V and the possessed target only gets an RR once every day.

19. Dark Slumbers - Target is put into a state of deep sleep and will neither awaken nor age. The target will only die if killed (does not need food, water, etc.). This sleep will continue until dispelled or until a sin -gle, non-magical event (specified by the caster at the time of casting) is accomplished. Note that the caster must specify the non-magical condi -tion (i.e., it is not optional).

20. Soultheft - As Subjugation , except the 'soul' is only released if the caster cancels the spell or the object is destroyed. The target is always aware of the direction of the object holding the stolen 'soul'.

25. Transferal True - As Transferal , except target only gets his addi -tional RRs once per month and every time he fails his chance to suc -cessfully resist decreases by 1 and the caster may operate normally in the target's body.

30. Long Absolution - [RR Mod: -20] Target's 'soul' is torn from the target's body (or other physical location if the soul is otherwise housed); it remains in whatever place 'souls' go for 30 days per 10 failure. The soul can be returned early only through Lifegiving or Reuniting . Target is  unconscious  until  soul  is  restored;  even  subconscious  activity  (i.e., healing, etc.) suffers a -75 penalty.

35. Possession VI - As Possession I , except Demon is Type VI and the possessed target only gets an RR once every week.

40.  Absolution  Pure -  [RR  Mod:  -20]  As Long  Absolution ,  except 'soul' can only be brought back through Lifegiving .

50.  Dark  Absolution -  [RR  Mod:  -20]  As Absolution  Pure ,  except 'soul' is utterly destroyed.

9.3 Sorcerer Base Lists

This chapter focuses in on particular groups of spells that can prove more difficult than most to interpret or apply  to  specific  situations,  especially  if  the  Game -master and players are coming to Rolemaster from a system that handles certain elements (e.g., illusions) differently. Still, it is impossible to cover every case or anticipate all potential questions. The general guide in interpreting spells is to use common sense and keep game balance in mind. Be especially wary of assum -ing abilities which are not actually granted to the spell by  the  text;  this  is  an  especially  common  source  of unbalancing effects.

#### 10.1. Bardic Songs

The Bard's Base lists Controlling Songs and Inspiring Songs are somewhat more elaborate in their casting than most spells are. A number of special rules apply to them:

- 1) Normally, Controlling Songs affect all targets in the radius of effect except for the caster. If the caster is using Song Mastery (see Sound Projection spell list), he may elect to include himself as a target of the Controlling Songs spell. Inspiring Songs work as explained in that list. In either case, someone en -tering the effect radius while the song is still active becomes a target for the spell.
- 2) All of the spells on these lists require that the Bard provide some form of entertainment for the targets; this is the 'performance'. This could take the form of singing, tale telling, juggling, etc. Since the per -formance is part of the spell-casting technique, use of the voice or hands for the performance counts as using them for spell-casting.
- 3) The area of effect listed is the base area of effect, used for a normal success on the maneuver roll for the performance. The duration is also determined by the maneuver roll for the performance, with a base duration in rounds equal to the number of ranks that the caster has in the skill used for the performance. If the caster uses two skills for a performance (he sings while playing the lute or dances while telling stories), the skill with the most ranks is used. The maneuver roll for the performance is made after the Controlling Songs or Inspiring Songs spell has been successfully  cast.  Stopping  the  performance  will end the spell (unless it has been augmented with an Echoes spell), regardless of how much time is left on the basic duration.
- 4) After the duration given by the result of the initial performance maneuver roll is over, the caster may

make a 'continuation roll' (consisting of an Abso -lute  Maneuver  using  the  performance  skill)  each round in order to maintain the concentration needed to perform. Each additional continuation roll after the  first  one  has  a  cumulative  -5  modifier.  These rolls  never  change  the  parameters  set  up  for  the spell  effects  by  the  initial  performance  roll.  They succeed on a roll over 100 and fail on a roll under 101. They are simply to maintain the performance as is for one more round per continuation roll.

- 5) The maneuver roll for the performance uses the fol -lowing table. 'Ranks' means the number of ranks the caster has in the skill used for the performance.

10.2. cURses and diseases

Curse and disease spells are handled in a special man -ner  with  regards  to  dispelling  and  canceling.  Such spells are normally unaffected by normal Dispel spells. Curse spells include all of the spells on the Curses list and a few other scattered spells. These spells can only be dispelled by an Uncurse or Purge Curse spell.

Disease spells include all of the spells on the Disease lists and a few other scattered spells. These spells can only be dispelled by an Undisease or Purge Disease spell.

Mental illness due to spells on the Mind Disease and Mind Subversion lists and a few other places may be removed by Mind Disease Cures , Uncurse , or Purge Curse .

Alternatively,  certain  diseases  may  be  'healed'  by using a healing spell or medical treatment.

#### 10.3. Demon Summoning and Familiar Spirits

The  Evil  Channeling  lists  Demonic  Pacts  and  De -monic  Summons  deal  with  the  bringing  of  demons into  the  caster's  world  and  obtaining  demonic  help. Demonic Summons is relatively straightforward, pro -viding spells to summon, banish, confine, and control demons. This is certainly enough to make use of de -mons for a number of ends, but Demonic Pacts offers additional possibilities.

Demons are a category of evil entities that normally dwell on planes of existence different from those of humankind.  Except  for  a  small  minority  with  inter -dimensional travel abilities of their own, demons can only come to a human world by being summoned, in which case the default case is that the demon can only stay a number of minutes equal to its own level before it is dragged back to its own plane by cosmic energies, or  perhaps  through  some  curse  of  a  protective  god. Various spells can allow the demon a longer stay.

The typical process of dealing with a demon through bargaining works as follows. First, the caster creates a Conjuring Circle and summons a demon inside the circle. The caster then negotiates for the services of the demon (typical tasks include obtaining an object, killing a target, or providing information in the case of more elite demons). If no agreement can be reached, the  caster  will  use Banish  Demon to  be  rid  of  his dangerous guest. If a bargain is made, the caster casts Oath of Binding upon himself and the demon, ensur -ing the bargain is kept. After this is done, the caster will use a Demonic Mission spell in order to provide the demon additional time to work, unless the demon's side of the bargain is quick to fulfill. Once the demon's task is done, the caster may often cast Unleash Demon as (part of) the payment of his side of the bargain. Pru -dent casters will include a clause in their bargains to ensure the demon's actions at that point do not include consuming the caster or wrecking his home.

Some spells on the Demonic Pacts list simply tap into the power of the demon planes and require little expla -nation here other than that their use is probably what most Clerics would term 'bad for the soul'.

##### Familiar Spirits

Familiar Spirit spells summon a familiar spirit, a de -monic entity that takes form in this world as an animal or  small  man  (sometimes  with  grotesque  or  impish features, but not always). This form may be changed, and any familiar spirit  is  likely  to  have  four  or  five common guises, of which it favors one. It can speak the caster's native language fluently, including while in  animal  form.  The  caster  must  keep  the  familiar spirit fed with a little of the caster's blood every six days or the familiar spirit will begin to waste away, losing 2d10 hits each day until it dies or is fed again. Because of this feeding, the caster suffers a -1 penalty to his Constitution stat per Stage of his familiar spirit. If the familiar spirit is killed, then the caster immedi -ately suffers a spiritual shock that strips him of all his Power Points for a period of 1 week per Stage of the familiar spirit and also takes an A Impact critical due to his intimate bond with the familiar spirit.

A Stage I familiar spirit has an Armor Type of 1 and a DB of 10, a +10 OB, 5 PP, and 20 concussion hits. It is level 1 and is considered to be Small size, although it may take forms that would normally be considered smaller. It can cast spells from 2 Open, Closed or Evil spell lists of any realm. All other statistics are based on the form it has taken.

It can provide one of the follow -ing benefits to the caster to whom it is attached, at the caster's choice at the time the Familiar Spirit V spell is cast: a +25 bonus to all SCRs or a +25 bonus to all Magical Ritual rolls or +5 to the caster's level when determining the parameters of spells cast or the benefit of a +5 Spell Adder or the benefit of a x2 PP multiplier.

A  Stage  VI  familiar  spirit  has  an Armor  Type  of  1 and a DB of 35, a +60 OB, 30 PP, and 70 concussion hits. It is level 6 and is considered to be Small size, although  it  may  take  forms  that  would  normally  be considered smaller. It can cast spells from 12 Open, Closed or Evil spell lists of any realm. All other statis -tics are based on the form it has taken. It can provide one of the following benefits to the caster to whom it is attached, at the caster's choice at the time the Familiar Spirit VI spell is cast: a +30 bonus to all SCRs or a +30 bonus to all Magical Ritual rolls or +6 to the caster's level when determining the parameters of spells cast or the benefit of a +6 Spell Adder or the benefit of a x2.5 PP multiplier.

In all cases, the familiar spirit can act as an assistant in spell research, and it can provide instruction in all Channeling  realm  spell  lists,  allowing  the  caster  to ignore any normal restrictions placed on learning lists due to the need for learning materials or teachers.

A familiar spirit recovers all spent PP at midnight each day.

10.4. detection sPells

When a spell 'detects' something, it simply reveals whether that thing is present in the area of effect or not. A Detect Hair spell would tell you whether or not there was hair in the area scanned, but it would not tell you how much or what kind(s) or where it was located within  that  area.  The  spell  would  respond  the  same way to several Dwarves waiting in ambush as it would to  a  braided  rope  of  horse  hair  or  a  single  stray  cat hair (which pretty well explains why there is no Detect Hair spell). The careful overlap of areas scanned over multiple rounds can sometimes overcome some lack of detail, narrowing down the location of a single instance of the thing detected.

#### 10.5. Dreams: Symbols, Sources and Locales

Dream spells and other similar divination spells are a valuable part of some fantasy environments, but some GMs are not comfortable with them. They represent an  'outside'  source  of  information  that  can  skew  a carefully planned story. The GM may decide to be ex -plicit in the information given, but it is recommended that any information be imparted through symbols and metaphor.  Animals,  music,  smells,  panoramas,  and other elements may be used to convey general mes -sages and vague clues to the information being sought.

Example: Khale has decided to employ his Dream spell to discover whether he should travel to Golgotha by ship or overland. That night he receives a dream of a sea-bird perched upon a piece of beached driftwood beneath a storming sky. Upon awaking, Khale realizes that he has received his dream, but it was not the decisive clue he was looking for and has created more questions than it has answered. Grumbling about double-dealing GMs, he decides to purchase a horse and travel overland than risk the strange portents of the dream.

In the above example, the dream might have implied that the PC would be shipwrecked or that the journey would be dangerous but successful. It might have also been  a  storming  sky  because  of  other  events  in  the background of the PC, rather than a reference to the journey itself. This method provides a check upon the abuse of these seemingly omniscient spells.

Other GMs will welcome such divinations as tools to move the campaign forward and keep players mov -ing in desirable directions. These GMs will generally provide clearer guidance, but should avoid providing direct answers and cloak dream answers in symbolism and indirect meaning, even if choosing forms that his players should find easy to interpret.

##### Realms and Dreams

A  Channeler  is  asking  his  deity  for  information  in dream form, so a lot depends on how the Gamemaster plays  deities  in  his  world.  The Dream will  incorporate information the deity knows, which may include incorrect  information  or  opinion.  The  clarity  of  the dream may depend on how closely the deity is able to think like the caster and also how much attention the deity devotes to responding to the dream request. Casting on a subject the deity is unaware of, or does not  want  the  caster  to  know,  will  have  poor  results, but casting on a topic the deity is deeply aware of and eager to share is likely to give a vivid, detailed, and on-topic dream.

A  Mentalist  is  delving  into  the  recesses  of  his  own mind, rummaging through bits and pieces of scattered information he may have no conscious awareness of and feeling  out  the  tiniest  vibrations  of  the  Essence running through his own head. This can be rather ran -dom or precise; dreams of this sort will tend to reflect the  information  the  caster  already  knows. The  more the caster knows, the more likely the answers will be found and 'stick' to them, and also, the greater the caster's understanding of the topic, the more likely the dream will be explicable. Taking a complete stab in the  dark  with  a  dream  spell  to  try  to  unravel  some -thing the mentalist has barely discovered will likely give a hard-to-understand, symbolic dream sparse in hard details. Trying to put together lots of details into a coherent context, or fill in the last bit of missing in -formation for something the caster knows a lot about should work far more smoothly.

There is also a difference in the kind of symbology that characterizes Dreams of  Channeling  and Dreams of Mentalism. Mentalism Dreams have a more personal symbology, whereas Channeling Dreams are typically  full  of  references  to  religious  symbols,  doctrines, and stories. A Channeler might get help interpreting a Dream from a religious scholar, whereas a Mental -ism-user would need to see a psychologist. Mentalism Dreams might also be more interactive and could be played out rather than simply described (as they are 'drawn from within' rather than 'sent from afar').

An Essence user  is  generally  more  grounded  in  the solidity of physical reality and deals in more limited, but non-symbolic, methods of gathering information. Hybrids will generally be casting dream spells from a single realm, but it is possible some visionary spell could appear on a hybrid base list, in which case the GM should mix the effects above.

##### Location and Dreams

The importance of location depends on how the Gam -emaster  treats  dreams.  Much  depends  on  if  dreams are a reflection of reality, tied to the material realm, or totally separated in an alternative dream realm. It is  entirely  possible  that  certain  locations  may  cause unexpected side  effects.  Casting  dream  spells  on  an old battlefield may mean that scenes of conflict may intrude into or be incorporated as part of the dream, while casting in the abandoned temple of a dark god might inadvertently draw that deity's attention. (This is completely at the discretion of the GM.)

#### 10.6. Elemental Spells

The effects  that  elemental  attacks  have  on  the  envi -ronment can sometimes be more than just the results on the table. This is more pronounced for ball attacks, but even bolts or small elemental creations can have a dramatic effect. It is often important for the GM to consider  the  context  around  which  these  spells  are cast, considering such things as 'Where did that Fire Bolt that missed the ranger go?'

Some things in the environment are very susceptible to effects, while some are more than normally resistant or almost immune. For purposes of this section, con -sider that susceptible items are affected by the element 100% of the time if they are directly in contact (either struck by a bolt or inside the radius of a ball, for in -stance). Normal items will be affected 20% of the time x the level of the critical effect (so 20% for A, 40% for B, 60% for C, 80% for D and 100% for E). Resistant items will be affected about 5% of the time x critical level, and generally, immune items will ignore all but the most potent effects. GMs should keep in mind that these  are  guidelines,  the  listings  are  not  exhaustive, and that this does not cover all situations, so they can feel free to tweak these numbers to fit specific situa -tions.

Due  to  the  'personal  aura'  detailed  in  Section  2.5, these effects generally apply to the environment, not to objects on characters or in the possession of char -acters. Those objects will only be directly affected by specific wording of a critical result.

##### Cold

Elemental cold is not visible as such, but it will produce condensation and frost in the area of effect, sufficient to produce a misty vapor in all but the driest areas if the  effect  is  a  lingering  one  (Cold  Ball  attacks  tend to just leave a layer of frost). In dry air, one may see only a distortion due to diffraction when light passes between  areas  of  different  temperature  (the  inverse of  a  'heat  shimmer').  Elemental  cold  is  also  silent, although  the  rapid  freezing  of  shallow  water  within the area of effect typically makes a 'cracking' sound.

##### Fire

Elemental fire burns cleanly, without smoke, but burns very  hot.  Due  to  the  fact  that  it  will  only  penetrate bodily auras as specified by critical, it does not usually have the terrible effects of normal fire, such as searing the air in your lungs, setting your hair and clothing on fire, and choking you with smoke.

Fire  spells  will  likely  crackle  and  roar  like  a  fire  of similar size. The color of the fire varies by magical tra -dition or individual artistry rather than by temperature.

Gamemasters should note that secondary fires started by elemental fire are normal and not restrained by aura resistance, so if a character is hiding in a loose pile of dry hay and gets hit with a fireball, after taking spell damage, that character will also now be in the middle of  a  raging  normal  fire,  and  subject  to  lung-searing temperatures,  smoke,  and  burning  equipment  prob -lems.

Fire  tends  to  spread  upward  and  in  the  direction  of airflow.  Remember  that  most  pre-modern  buildings are held up by wooden beams, including stone castles and mineshaft-like subterranean tunnels, so an uncon -trolled fire will cause a collapse after the beams are weakened enough. (The technique of treating beams with tar to prevent rot makes for fast-spreading, hot, smoky fires.) Treat smoke as a respiratory poison (see RMCL Section 15.6), except coughing (-20) replaces mild  euphoria,  and  confusion  and/or  disorientation (-30) replaces significant euphoria.

Small,  light  objects  will  be  sucked  up  into  the  fire, ignite if inflammable as they rise, then rain down once they depart the column of super-heated air above the fire. When taken to an extreme, this is referred to as a 'firestorm' and the falling debris can range in size from burning leaves to small burning branches and roof shingles. This process, in dry conditions, can cause the already dangerous walls and 'arms' of spreading fire to 'jump', spawning multiple fires, mostly downwind of the initial fire.

##### Ice

Non-mobile ice spells are generally fairly benign, but will  be  super  cold  in  the  round  of  casting.  Bolts  or similar attacks will cause both impact and cold crit -icals. A mass of super cold elemental ice surrounded by super cold air capable of the effects listed can have some interesting secondary effects.

If  an  elemental  ice  spell  is  cast  onto  water,  it  can freeze quickly, perhaps quickly enough to trap beings standing or swimming in it. This is more likely with shallow water, like casting an ice bolt at the feet of someone walking through ankle deep water in a storm drain tunnel. In deep water, if not secured or attached to  something,  ice  will  float  to  the  surface  and  then travel with the current, if any.

Ice bolts or falling ice walls will often be loud, consid -ering the mass of the ice and what was struck. A stone corridor  wall  or  floor  will  produce  a  sharp  crack  or crash, but a metal door will gong like a poorly tuned bell.

##### Lightning

Lightning  is  very  potent.  Objects  struck  by  lightning may conduct jumps of electricity, but may also be bro -ken, moved (if light), or set on fire at the same time. If elemental lightning were not hampered by the aura effect, it would be far deadlier than the Lightning Bolt table suggests, as powerful a weapon as it is.

Lightning  is  always  associated  with  thunder  and  can be heard from miles away outdoors; indoors the noise alone will be enough to temporarily deafen people and break delicate objects and glass windows. Not a sneaky magic,  lightning  should  alert  every  conscious  person that  something  happened  within  a  gigantic  radius. Only during a storm would such a noise seem normal. Few buildings are large  enough  to  bother  calculating the distance required for the noise of thunder failing to travel to every nook and corner, and outdoors the range is measured in miles. Soundproofing would need to be very complete to block the noise, doors on a lesser scale than wood, stone, or metal measured in feet of thick -ness would just reverberate, transmitting the noise. (A Sphere of Silence spell  with  a  large  enough  radius  to cover the whole lightning stroke would work).

The  other  side  of  the  coin  is  that  while  lightning  is unsubtle, it is also awe-inspiring, and beasts, the more beast-like monsters, and even members of sapient races who have not had much exposure to magic can be pan -icked into fleeing after even a single strike with such elemental power.

##### Shock

Weaker than lightning, shock behaves similarly, but ev -ery aspect is less intense. Shocks will sizzle and crack, loudly, but not nearly on the scale of lightning: not loud enough to temporarily deafen and inaudible from long distances or beyond normal doors or walls. Consider it similar to the noise of a mad scientist's laboratory in an old movie.

##### Water

Water will have only one effect beyond direct impact; it will get things wet. Water will flow downward from wherever it comes to rest after the spell is cast; if in sufficient quantities, it will drown creatures that need to breathe. (An unconscious, sleeping, or downed person laying face down can drown in an inch or less of wa -ter.) Water bolts will be less loud than ice, tending to lose much of the shock that creates noise in 'splash'. Striking a gong or bell with a water bolt will still be quite noisy. Elemental water is pure and is an electrical insulator. After one round in most environments, how -ever,  it  will  have  picked  up  electrolytes  and  become electrically conductive.

10.7. fatal channeling PRojections

Some who seek divine aid call for the death or mu -tilation  of  their  enemies.  Among  the  most  dreaded weapons  of  the  magic  arts  are  the  fatal  Channeling projections.

Fatal  Channeling  projections  fall  into  2  categories; they may (1) destroy the soul or life's Essence of the target or they may (2) destroy all or part of the target's body. The former group consists of those projections known as Absolutions ,  spells  normally  found  in  the higher reaches of power. The latter category embraces what are commonly called Black Channels .

While Absolutions refer  to  specific  spells  of  power, Black Channels tend to vary with culture. The nice -ties  of  ritual  and  form  mark  the  only  great  cultural distinctions between the sources of Absolution . Black Channels , however, produce widely differing results, many based on the preferences of ancestral prejudice.

The detailed  effects  of Absolution s  are  found  in  the appropriate spell lists. Specific aspects of Black Channels are also noted on the appropriate lists; nonethe -less,  most of the actual results of usage are dictated by cultural choice and spell variation. Thus, the table below  has  been  provided.  Certain  users  of Black

Channels may have a choice with regard to which type they use in a specific situation. Others will be bound by cultural/religious restrictions and may use only one variation. Black Channel III effects are lethal. Death takes place 1-10 rounds after the target is affected, and the effects incapacitate the target during this time.

Obviously,  many  other  terrible  effects  are  possible, and GMs or players may wish to create unique Black Channels better suited to cultures in their own cam -paigns. Power should be kept to the same level as the examples given, and the GM is (as always) the final arbiter  of  the  appropriateness  of  any  proposed  addi -tions.

10.8. good, evil, daRk and light

There  are  a  number  of  'alignment'  spells  in Spell Law . Largely, the application of these spells depends upon the system of morals the GM is using within the game  world.  For  these  purposes,  Good  is  assumed to be primarily motivated to promote the well-being and happiness of others or to combat those forces that stand  against  it  (i.e.,  Evil).  Evil  is  characterized  as that which causes intentional suffering or destruction and that which strives to overthrow good. These defi -nitions  may  (and  should)  be  altered  to  fit  the  GM's particular view of these concepts.

'Of Light' is defined as something of 'Good' origins (regardless of whether the thing itself is Good or not). 'Of Darkness' is defined as something of 'Evil' or -igins (regardless of whether the thing itself is Evil or not).

'Holy' is defined as a person, place or object mag -ically blessed by any priest or servant of a deity (or even the deity itself). Note that this may also include the concept of 'Unholy', if Holy is applied to a Good blessing and Unholy applied to an Evil blessing.

10.9. healing

Wounds have several aspects. Hits of damage, bleed -ing,  and  stun  effects  all  have  their  own  specialized healing spells. Restoring hits and removing stun take place immediately; bleeding is handled according to the spell used (see individual spell descriptions).

The most lasting non-lethal effects are generally in -juries,  which  apply  a  penalty  to  applicable  actions. Non-magical healing of injuries is covered in RMCL Section 13.1. The effects of magical healing are sim -ilar,  but spells have certain advantages over medical skills. In the first place, no maneuver roll is required to treat the injury. If the spell is successfully cast, the

patient  is  on  the  road  to  recovery.  When  rolling  on RMCL Table 13-1a, magical treatment provides a +50 to the roll to determine recovery time. Medical skill can be combined with magical treatment, but requires an Absolute Success to be helpful (in which case the +25 bonus on RMCL Table 13-1a for Absolute Suc -cess combines with the +50 for magical treatment for a +75 bonus). Magical herbs may be combined with spells for doubly magical healing, in which case, the combined bonus for both spell and herb is +75 on the recovery time table (with a potential +100 total if an Absolute Success with medical skill is also achieved). The use of magical healing also eliminates the chance of permanent injury, so long as the magical treatment is applied within 24 hours.

These  are  the  advantages  that  come  when  treating an injury with a Relief spell. A Healing spell has the same advantages, but will also reduce the necessary recovery  time  from  days  to  hours,  while  a Healing True spell will reduce the recovery time from days to rounds. For Mass spells that treat multiple injuries at once, use the most severe injury treated and roll once for a single recovery time for all.

Cinematic Healing

Some GMs may wish to establish a less gritty tone, where even serious wounds are shrugged off and a set  of  broken  ribs  in  one  scene  is  forgotten  by  the next.  In  this  case, Relief spells  should  produce  a recovery  in  hours, Healing spells  in  minutes,  and Healing True should bypass recovery time altogeth -er. Note that in addition to the change in tone, where injury less than death becomes much less serious (as long as there is a healer around), this option devalues medical skill, since even low-level spells become so much better than what one can achieve through Med -icine or Herbalism maneuvers.

#### 10.10. Illusions and Mind Tricks

Illusions as handled in Rolemaster are one of the most unique and difficult aspects of the magical framework of  the  system.  Newcomers  to Rolemaster are  often bewildered by illusions being modeled as temporary creations of reality rather than as mental phenomena as is the case with other role-playing games. There are other spells in Rolemaster that  do  correspond to the mental effects seen in other systems. These are spells from the Cloaking and Seemings lists and an assort -ment of other spells, mostly of the realm of Mentalism, which may be collectively grouped as 'mind tricks'.

##### Illusions

Illusions include all spells that create or manipulate a physical (or psychic, in the case of Presence illusions) element perceived by one of the six senses used in Spell Law : sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch (i.e., feel), and Presence. Such spells include: Illusions , Phantasms , Mirages , Façades , Misfeels ,  etc.  Thus Illusions and related spells are of the type Elemental (E).

The  sense  aspects  (i.e.,  physical  elements)  of  such spells are actually created. Because of this, all poten -tial  perceivers  actually  sense  an  illusion  and  Resistance Rolls are not made to 'not sense an illusion'. For example, a Light Mirage spell will actually create an image that consists of the physical element, light (much like a hologram), so anyone looking at a Light Mirage will see the image.

A reflection of an object in a mirror is a real world example of this principle. The reflection is not the real object, but the light constituting the reflection is real light and as such affects the viewer's eyes in the nor -mal way. Given a sufficiently perfect mirror, it is im -possible to tell if the object in the mirror is a reflection or  the  real  object  without  recourse  to  another  sense other than sight. The suspected object can be proven to be a reflection by attempting to touch it. However, the reflected object does not disappear once it is known to be merely a reflection. Instead, it remains until the mirror (or the original object) is removed.

Likewise, Rolemaster illusions  cannot  be  merely disbelieved.  If  an  Illusionist  creates  an  illusion  of an object, then a suspicious viewer must verify with some  other  sense  (although  a  high-level  Illusionist can make an object real to all senses) or by magical means that the object is illusionary rather than real. A viewer might conclude that it is an illusion because of the nature of the illusion, but a viewer might likewise

conclude a real event was an illusion because of how bizarre it seemed. The illusionary object will not dis -appear merely because a viewer has perceived its true nature, and the illusion must be cancelled, dispelled or the spell duration waited out.

Normally,  the  caster  of  the  illusion  will  be  creating things which he has either personal familiarity with or are creative variations on such things. If the illusion is of something with which the caster has no personal experience, the GM may want to call for a maneuver to determine the quality and believability of the illusion. This may be done on the basis of applicable skills re -lated to the subject of the illusion (e.g., Creature Lore: Dragon if creating an illusion of a dragon) or, more generally, with Composition: Illusion Crafting.

Illusions can always be self-illuminating, but in order to illuminate objects that are not part of the illusion re -quires an advanced illusion/phantasm with the option to 'cast light' taken. If this is done, then lights that are part  of  the  illusion  will  illuminate  as  they  normally would. This may include illusions of regular magical light, if the creator of the illusion knows the light spell to be emulated. While this has certain advantages for magical lighting, it also has limitations that the Light spells do not (an illusion is limited to the caster's field of vision and cannot be tied to a mobile source).

If one of the senses in an illusion is 'feel', then the illusion feels real to a target's touch senses. Striking part of such an illusion will cause the 'feel' part of the illusion to be cancelled, but the rest of the illusion will remain for the normal duration of the spell. An illusion can be given multiple 'feel' senses by using options from an Illusion # spell or a Phantasm # spell, in which case, each blow to the illusion cancels one of the 'feel' senses. Such a blow constitutes an attack when done deliberately, and it automatically succeeds against a static illusion, while a mobile illusion may have  a  DB  assigned  depending  on  its  evasiveness (usually the same as the creature it appears to be). The Armor Type (AT) of an illusion is always AT 1. It is also  possible  to  accidentally  strike  an  illusion  hard enough to remove a 'feel' from it. Anytime someone makes a maneuver which might result in delivering a  blow  to  an  illusion  (e.g.,  running  across  an  illu -sion of a bridge), a roll should be made and a 'feel' is  lost  if  the  result  is  less  than  or  equal  to  a  certain value based upon the difficulty of the maneuver. The suggested values are: Routine or easier (no roll), Easy (02), Light (05), Medium (10), Hard (15), Very Hard (20), Extremely Hard (25), Sheer Folly (40), Absurd (50), Nigh Impossible (75). The maximum weight an illusion  can  support  is  150%  of  the  caster's  weight, doubled for each additional 'feel' in the illusion. Thus a 180-pound caster creating an illusion of stairs with three 'feel' components provides a means of ascent that can support 180 x 1.5 x 4 = 1080 pounds. If one of those 'feel' components is destroyed, the stairs will only support 180 x 1.5 x 2 = 540 pounds. Exceeding this  weight  limit  immediately  cancels  all  remaining 'feels'.

A Phantasm with 'feel' as one of the senses used can strike a blow against a target; the blow is the equiva -lent of a Medium Martial Arts Strike attack, with an OB based on the caster's skill in Directed Spell: Illu -sionary Attacks. With an Easy Spell Mastery roll, the caster can change the critical type done by the attack in order to keep the illusion more convincing (e.g., an illusion of a flame could be made to do a Heat critical). If a Phantasm has been given multiple 'feel' senses by using options from a Phantasm # spell, each attack cancels one of the 'feel' senses.

If a Phantasm has been given increased 'size' by us -ing options from an Phantasm # spell, the concussion hit  damage from an attack is increased one multiple for each option so used (e.g., if two options are used to increase the 'size' to a 40'R, the attack's concussion hit  damage  is  three  times  normal,  i.e.,  increased  by two over the basic x1). This is limited to four times (x4) the normal damage.

It  should  be  remembered  that  the  range  at  which  a given sensory aspect of an illusion can be perceived is  limited only by the capabilities of the observer in the given environment. The Area of Effect parameter limits only the size of the illusion.

Example: An Illusionist casts an Illusion spell to create a 'bridge'. The size of the bridge is limited by the Area of Effect parameter. The illusionary bridge is visible to any being who happens to look in the right direction. It reflects light just like a real bridge. If the Illusionist has added a feel mirage to the illusion, then when someone touches the bridge, it will feel like wood or stone. If someone is brave enough to step on to the bridge, then he will feel the wood or stone under his feet. If he is careful, light, and/or lucky, the feel aspect may last long enough for him to cross the bridge. His companions would see him cross the bridge. If a companion tried the same feat, but through bad luck, carelessness, or greater encumbrance, overwhelmed the feel mirage, then the companion would immediately cease to feel the wood or stone under his feet, would fall through the bridge, and plummet to his (possible) death.

##### Mind Tricks

Mind tricks are purely mental phenomena which di -rectly affect the brain of the chosen target(s). They are therefore Force (F) Type spells, allowing a Resistance Roll  against  their  effects.  These  are  categorized  as cloaks, projections, overlays and seemings.

A cloak is a mind trick which will cause the affected target(s) to fail to perceive a chosen object, entity, etc. It  creates  a  delusion  of  absence  which  removes  the information concerning the concealed object or entity from one or more processing centers (concerned with the chosen senses) in the brain(s) of the target(s). One subtlety,  which  applies  to Cloak spells  or  any  other future visual cloaking spells, concerns what the targets see in place of a concealed being or item. The con -cealed object is not invisible, which means an affected target  cannot  see  through  the  concealed  object.  The answer must be that the target's brain interpolates a background. If the target has viewed the area prior to the concealed being moving into the area, then a pre -vious image from short-term memory is reused. If the target has never seen the area before, then the target's mind will invent a reasonable image which will likely not stand up to intense scrutiny (i.e., concentrated use of Perception) but will be swiftly readjusted as soon as the concealed being moves out of the way.

Example: A party of adventurers enters a dragon's cave. The sleeping dragon is under the effects of a Cloaking spell and is resting on its hoard. The adventurers can only really see the periphery of the treasure hoard, and so their minds interpolate the rest of the hoard. One of the greedier adventurers is sure that the hoard will contain golden weapons from the Royal Armory of the Lost Realm and looks closely for any sign of such items. His mind invents a large golden sword. The dragon shifts and he sees that actually there is a bejeweled silver torc at that position. The greedy adventurer is allowed another Resistance Roll. His companions who did not force their minds to invent the detail of a sword merely have the true view added to their existing perceptions in a self-consistent fashion - they merely did not notice the silver torc at first glance.

A projection is a mind trick which causes the affected target(s) to experience some specific sensation, experi -ence, or distortion of sense data. These are typified by the Mind Illusions list. Note that this does not include the majority of a Mentalist's Base list attacks. The ar -senal of the Mentalist is sufficiently refined to inflict real damage through manipulation of the target's ner -vous system and is not a form of mind trickery - the experiences are physically real.

Although  cloaks  and  projections  directly  affect  the mind  of  a  target,  both  sets  of  spells  may  be  used against  any  target  with  at  least  a  rudimentary  mind. The  specificity  of  the  effects  counterbalances  their general applicability.

An overlay is a mind trick which alters how an actual object, entity, or place is perceived in the mind of the target(s). The object, entity, or place retains its basic nature, so a rusty knife can appear as a silver dagger but not as a book. An Overlay spell acts to transform the  information  within  a  sensory  processing  center regarding the actual object such that the object is per -ceived by the target as the spell-caster desires.

A seeming is  a mind trick which causes the affected target(s) to perceive an object, entity, or place which is not real. The object, entity, or place is a pure hallucina -tion; a Seeming spell acts upon the sensory processing centers of the brain to add to, subtract from, or other -wise transform the information such that the affected target perceives what is desired by the spell-caster.

As  both Overlay and Seeming spells  can  create  an infinite  variety  of  hallucinations  employing  a  com -bination of senses, they normally only affect human -oid targets. These spells can affect targets other than humanoids, if they are preceded with an appropriate spell. The Seemings spell list only contains one such spell, Animal  Seeming ,  but  others  are  theoretically possible.

Overlay and Seeming spells continuously interact with the affected targets. This is usually accomplished by the caster concentrating upon the specific spell in or -der to adjust the hallucination so that it remains plau -sible regardless of the actions of the affected target(s). The caster can choose instead to set a limited number of reactions to possible actions of the affected target(s) to the hallucination in advance. For example, Aran has successfully cast a Seeming upon a desert nomad. The nomad is now convinced that a vulture is circling his camp overhead. At the time of casting, Aran decided to  set  up  a  number  of  variations,  one  of  which  will cause the imaginary vulture to gain altitude should the nomad notch an arrow to his deadly recurve bow, and another will cause the imaginary vulture to dodge out of the way if an arrow is loosed in its direction. Unfor -tunately, the desert nomad actually chooses to cast a long-range elemental bolt at the vulture. The Seeming spell  has  no  preprogrammed  response  to  this  unex -pected  action,  and  the  vulture  flies  through  the  bolt unharmed. If Aran is lucky, perhaps the nomad will consider this event to be evidence that the vulture is of supernatural origin and immune to such attacks. In this case, however, the event is more likely to trigger disbelief and terminate the hallucination.

All  of  the  various  mind  tricks  actively  engage  the minds of the chosen targets. As a consequence, these spells can be resisted by the targets, i.e., a Resistance Roll is permitted. If the target fails to resist, then the illusionary  effect  is  real  within  the  confines  of  the target's mind. Targets who successfully resist and by -standers  who  were  not  targeted  will  not  be  affected by these spells. Moreover, even targets who initially succumb are allowed opportunities to snap out of the hallucination if unaffected senses provide information which is inconsistent with the hallucination or, as in the case of Aran and the nomad, the hallucination be -comes implausible.

Gamemasters  should  note  that  this  is  neither  an  in -vitation to characters to develop an extreme solipsist philosophy (uttering 'I don't believe it' at every op -portunity) nor carte blanche to the caster of Seeming spells to generate wildly implausible mental images. In  general,  people  in  fantasy  settings  will  be  more willing to ascribe the wondrous to magical, supernat -ural,  or  miraculous  causes,  but  even  their  credulity can be stretched beyond its limits. Those limits will depend on the nature of the gamemaster's setting.

Example: Aran, an avid user of the Seemings list, is in a place of concealment, quietly observing a group of four soldiers approaching the river. He decides to induce the hallucination of a bridge spanning the river in the minds of the soldiers. (There is no limit on the size of the bridge that he can create in an observer's mind.) He notes that one of the soldiers is accompanied by a pet bird and hopes that this is not a wizard' s familiar. He casts a Seeming X spell. He chooses the options of adding sound and feel aspects, three additional targets, doubling the duration, and increasing the range to 800'. The soldiers fail to resist the spell and on looking towards the river they observe what appears to be a small bridge. (The pet bird is unaffected by the Seeming and observes nothing.) They hurry towards the supposed bridge and are surprised to see that it is of new construction.

One of the soldiers decides rashly to cross the bridge. The rash soldier now is experiencing a falling sensation incompatible with the supposed bridge beneath his feet and for him, the seeming ends. His companions see their comrade walking confidently across the bridge. The pet bird however sees the rash soldier step into mid-air and immediately fall. It squawks in alarm. The soldiers above hear the alarmed cry of the falling soldier, but it sounds appropriately muffled by the bridge (since it includes a sound aspect) and do not lose their belief in the appearance of the bridge. They mistake the noise for the howling of some animal.

The unfortunate soldier plunges into the river, swallowing some water involuntarily as his head goes below the surface. He resurfaces, spluttering somewhat, and swims towards the near bank, whilst his comrades try to calm their pet. If they look in the direction of the bridge, they would see their companion standing on the other end of the bridge and might wonder why he has failed to step off the bridge. (The subject of the Seeming spell was the bridge, not the soldier. Thus Aran cannot project the visual subcomponent (of the soldier) beyond the bridge.)

The rather wet and bedraggled soldier clambers up the river bank and squelches towards his companions. One of the soldiers turns at the sound and sees his comrade both standing dry on the bridge and dripping wet on the bank. His disbelief is triggered and the bridge disappears from his view. He swears.

Aran, seeing his victim has survived apparently unscathed, grimly cancels his spell and prepares to escape the wrath of the soldiers.

#### 10.11. Invisibility

Only objects/beings totally contained in an invisibility radius  at  the  time  of  casting  become  invisible;  such an  object/being  would  become  visible  upon  totally leaving  the  radius;  such  an  object/being  would  also become  visible  upon  violating  the  normal Unseen/ Invisibility restrictions  (e.g.,  attacking,  receiving  a violent blow, etc.), but the other objects/beings associ -ated with the radius would remain invisible. However, objects  within  the  same  aura  do  become  visible,  so after  stabbing  the  Duke,  not  only  do  you  appear,  so does the knife you used, your clothes, and whatever else is on your person.

Any  solid  material  that  enters  an  invisibility  radius after casting will produce a 'fringe effect' (i.e., will blur slightly, will seem slightly out of focus); potential observers may make a Perception roll to see if they notice the effects of the invisibility. If an observer is alert, suggested difficulties are:

- Absurd :  One  being  walking  with  a  1"  radius  about his person;
- Sheer Folly : One being moving at faster than a walk -ing pace with a 1" radius;
- Extremely Hard : One being walking with a 1' radius about his person;
- Very Hard : One being moving at faster than a walk -ing pace with a 1' radius;
- Hard : A 10'R or larger moving at a walking pace;
- Medium :  A  10'R  or  larger  moving  at  faster  than  a walking pace.

For Unseen spells, treat as a 1" radius for purposes of Perception rolls.

If the invisibility is not moving there is an additional modification of -20. If the observer is within 10' of the fringe effect there is an additional modification of +20. If the spell allows for a variable radius, this reduces the 'fringe effect' and modifies any attempt to detect it by -10.

Attacks against invisible targets are modified by -50 to  -100,  unless  the  attacker  benefits  from  a See  Invisible spell or otherwise can see the target (i.e., it is not invisible to the attacker). However, the invisible target must be detected in some way before an attack can  even  be  attempted  (via  the  fringe  effect, Detect Invisible ,  some  disturbance,  mental  detection,  etc.). The lowest penalty (-50) applies when the attacker has a good idea of the position of the target (e.g., seeing the  fringe  effect  or  the  target's  footprints)  while  the highest penalty (-100) applies when the attacker has only  a  general  idea  that  the  target  is  within  an  area

(e.g., the attacker heard the target moving nearby and knows they must be within weapon reach). Combat Expertise: Blind Fighting skill may be used to offset these penalties.

Invisibility is  a  very  useful  and  powerful  group  of spells. This type of spell normally lasts 24 hours or until the target attacks or until the target is struck by a violent blow. Often an invisible character (or creature) attempting a maneuver has a chance of bumping into something or taking a jarring blow due to stumbling or landing. In such a case after the maneuver roll, we sug -gest that a roll be made and that the character becomes visible if the result is less than or equal to a certain value based upon the difficulty of the maneuver. The suggested values are: Routine or easier (no roll), Easy (02), Light (05), Medium (10), Hard (15), Very Hard (20), Extremely Hard (25), Sheer Folly (40), Absurd (50), Nigh Impossible (75). Of course if the character takes an Unbalancing critical due to the result of the maneuver, the character becomes visible. If the result is 'fail to act', no visibility roll is required. The Resilient Invisibility spells of the Mystic Hiding spell list are more robust and can survive the target making at least one attack (physical or magical) or being struck by at least one violent blow.

Certain factors may improve perception rolls made to detect invisible objects or beings.

Rain/Water :  Rain or water rushing on and over the area of effect of an invisibility spell will improve the chances  of  perceiving  an  invisible  area  through  the heightened 'fringe effect' of the rain passing through the radius limit. Modifications to any Perception rolls shift the difficulty of the maneuver by 2 to 3 difficulty categories,  depending  on  the  amount  of  water,  size of the invisibility radius, and lighting. This assumes that the rain is sufficiently light that it does not itself obscure  vision.  If  detecting  the  visible  has  become difficult, detecting the invisible is going to be nigh-im -possible.

Dust/Powder/Paint : Any substance that will coat an object will do so normally with an invisible object. An invisible being covered in flour, for instance, would be visible as a white figure, allowing normal perception. The effects can range from making the invisible being obvious (covered in neon green slime in the middle of well-lit room) to merely slightly more visible than invisible (covered in coal dust in dark shadows).

Snow/Sand/Dust : Any substance that will show foot -prints will normally reveal the presence of someone invisible. Difficulty of noticing the footprints depends on circumstances, including whether or not the char -acter is looking for them.

Hangings :  Bead  curtains,  cloth  curtains,  and  other loose hanging barriers make life only modestly incon -venient at worst, but make it very hard to sneak around invisibly. Then again, doors that are kept shut when not passing through them do much the same job.

Other  Senses :  Obviously,  being  invisible  only  pro -tects  you  from  the  sense  of  sight.  You  still  need  to Stalk successfully to move around quietly and odors may  give  you  away,  especially  to  animals,  such  as dogs, that rely on their noses at least as much as their eyes.

#### 10.12. Life, Lifegiving &amp; Life Drain

When the body can no longer sustain life (due to sys -tem shock, organ failure or other causes), the soul will leave the host five minutes after death occurs ( Absolution spells can cause the soul to be removed from the body without causing actual death). To restore life, it is necessary to first repair the damage that caused the body to become uninhabitable and then to either re -start the heart (if the soul is still present) or restore the soul via Lifegiving .  If  the  physical damage were not repaired,  the  soul  would  immediately leave the host again.  Failure  to  restore  the  soul  prevents  the  target from returning to life even after all physical damage is repaired (the body can sustain life at a minimal level without the soul, but once the life process is interrupt -ed  it  cannot  be  restored  without  the  soul).  Detailed rules on death and dying are given in RMCL Section 13.2.

Lifegiving spells reunite the soul and the body, restor -ing the life process if the body is capable of sustaining it.  (Upon  entry  into  its  restored  body,  the  soul  will restart life processes, including the heartbeat.) Reuniting spells restore the soul to a still living body (only). Neither can restore a soul that is destroyed by Dark Absolution . Lifekeeping spells  prevent the soul from leaving the body at all, regardless of the condition of the body.

A priest may well need a good reason to request the return of a soul, depending on the setting and the deity. Additionally, if the soul is unwilling to be restored to life, this spell will not force it. Attempts may be made to  contact  the  dead,  if  such  abilities  exist,  and  con -vince them to come back, or answers may be sought via Commune or  other  informational  spells  that  can reach beyond the mortal realm.

Life drain is an impairment of a being's life essence, which  is  represented  by  penalties  to  his  stats  (e.g., Constitution,  Empathy,  Reasoning,  etc.).  Life  drain can occur from proximity to undead creatures, from spells such as from the Mind Erosions list (Evil Men -talism), or from being raised from the dead. Life drain is healed with the Heal Life Essence spells (Life Mas -tery).

See Creature Law for  the  effects  of  life  draining  by the undead. Unlike the effects of the undead, life drain from spells is never fatal and is limited to reducing the effective stat modifier to -20 (e.g., if the normal mod -ifier for the stat is +3, life draining spells may reduce this by 23).

#### 10.13. Lore Spells

Some spells have 'Lore' in the title and give informa -tion about places or things. The GM may freely give the information or may decide a Lore maneuver roll is required in which case the Lore spell gives +100 to the maneuver roll.

When Lore spells are described as revealing the 'val -ue'  of  something  (plant,  herb,  stone,  etc.),  the  GM must interpret this, as 'value' can mean many things. Financial  value  probably  comes  first  to  the  mind  of most readers, but this is a cultural bias. It is what is meant in other contexts (Dabbler Base list spells, for example), but this interpretation seems inappropriate for  Nature's  Law,  a  nature-centered  channeling  list, but giving all uses of a plant seems perhaps too gener -ous, so we suggest that it would depend on the god. A god of agriculture would give a lot of information on a food plant, including use in crop rotation schemes. A god of the household would give information on a food  plant  centering  on  nutrition  and  good  ways  to prepare it (great for making pies!). On the other hand, they would have much less information to offer about a stone than would a god of the earth. A god of war would identify  a  tree  as  good  for  producing  spears, making  bows,  building  wagons,  or  concealment  for ambush. A god of pleasure might tell you that it burns nicely or is a good shade tree. A god of wildlife might tell you owls like to nest in it or that the leaves feed deer in the autumn.

Something  like,  'this  plant  can  restore  life  to  the drowned' would be big enough news anyone would learn such a thing, but only a god of, e.g., healing or water would also tell how to use it. A god of wisdom could provide full information on anything. A god of trade  or  theft  would  likely  give  value  in  economic terms, although a god of trade would also note uses for transportation.

#### 10.14. Locks and Traps

Locks  and  traps  (and  other  mechanisms)  are  rated according  to  their  complexity,  which  combines  the sophistication of the device with the difficulty in un -locking/disarming it. This modifier applies to any skill attempt to unlock/disarm the device. If a spell (e.g., Opening I or Disarm I ) is used to attempt to unlock/ disarm a device, the chance of the spell successfully operating is modified by half of the normal modifier.

#### 10.15. Movement Spells and Encumbrance

When dealing with movement spells (e.g., Fly , Levitation , Leaving , Long  Door ,  etc.),  spells  handle  up to 1.5 times the caster's mass (weight). This includes the caster's own weight, if the caster is subject to the spell's effect. A caster may attempt to exceed this lim -it, but this produces an extra chance of the spell failing (this does not result in a roll on the Spell Failure table, simply  in  the  spell's  duration  terminating  upon  the failure). The caster must attempt a Spell Mastery ma -neuver, with a basic difficulty of Medium and a penal -ty of -1 for each pound in excess of the normal limit.

#### 10.16. Path Spells

The  various  'Path'  spells  ( Pathfinding , Path  Lore , etc.) share a common definition of 'path.' A 'Path', for  these  purposes,  is  a  road,  track,  or  way  created or constructed for a purpose, along which something travels  or  moves  with  at  least  moderate  frequency. This may have been constructed by men, animals, or other means.

In addition, the bounds of the path, for the purposes of these spells, should be between those points at which a larger path, population center (e.g., village, town, city, etc.), or dead end intersects the original. For instance, if the character casts a Path Lore on a secondary road between the King's Highway and the Imperial Road, those two larger 'paths' will mark the endpoints of the path, even if the road extends beyond both.

#### 10.17. “Sticky” Elemental Spells

Normally, type E spells do not allow an RR to avoid the attack or effect. However, if a caster tries to place an E spell with a duration on a target that would re -ceive an RR against an F spell, the target gets an RR, with success indicating that the effect will be centered upon the target's location at the time of the casting, rather than upon the target individual. This does not negate the effect, but prevents the effect from being 'attached' to the target, so the target can move away from it. (See Light and Darkness spells for examples.)

#### 10.18. Stun Relief and Awakening Spells

A Stun  Relief spell  may  be  cast  normally  while stunned (to any degree) with no penalty. Similarly, an Awake spell may be cast while unconscious or asleep if circumstances alert the caster/spell's senses. In both cases, it is assumed that the spell is triggered subcon -sciously.

#### 10.19. Transformation Spells

Spells  that  transform  the  caster  or  target  into  other creatures (or even plants) must be handled with cau -tion.  The  lower  level  changing  spells  only  give  the physical  form,  without  the  commensurate  abilities or powers. It is simply as if the recipient of the spell had been altered to appear like the desired creature. Combat abilities, flying abilities, or any other special aspect  are  not  received.  If  a  'changing'  spell  indi -cates that physical abilities are received, then purely physical abilities may be utilized, such as armor type, flight, and the use of natural weaponry (no skill with these  abilities  are  received  unless  stated  otherwise, but the caster may develop such skills). No magical or special abilities are received (no breath weapons, magical  immunities,  spell  capabilities,  etc.).  These abilities are only received if the spell explicitly states that  such  abilities  are  possible.  In  some  cases,  there may be  some  ambiguity  as  to  whether  an  ability  is physical or magical. In such cases, the GM must make a judgment and should make a note of this judgment to allow consistent treatment of this matter in the future.

#### 10.20. Wall and Similar Spells

Any 'wall' created by a spell must rest on a solid sur -face when initially created. It cannot be created in the same space as other solid material-it can only dis -place liquids and gases. With all such walls, the caster has the option of freely varying the width and height (not the thickness) up to the allowed dimensions of the spell. If the caster attempts to 'fill' a space with a wall, the wall will not fit perfectly (i.e., not snuggly), unless an Extremely Hard Spell Mastery maneuver succeeds. Reducing the thickness of the wall is possible with a Very  Hard  Spell  Mastery  maneuver.  Creating  firing slits in a wall is an Extremely Hard Spell Mastery with an additional -10 for each slit after the first. Slits can be no closer together than 5' in any case.

#### 10.21. “Of Kind” Spells

Many mind-affecting  and  other  targeted  spells  have the word 'Kind' in them, being short for kindred. The default assumption is that these spells are designed to apply to  all  the  humanoid  races,  where  'humanoid' is interpreted in a broad sense, such that it would in -clude humans, elves, dwarves, etc., but also centaurs, merfolk, hira'raz'hir, and so on. GMs need to consider whether this also applies to say a Dragon spellcaster -  it  might  be  that  their  'Of  Kind'  spells  also  target humanoid races or it  might  be  that  their  'Of  Kind' spells target their own kindred (i.e. dragons and simi -lar creatures).

For over four decades, Rolemaster has been the definitive fantasy role-playing game that combines realism and depth without sacrificing playability. Rolemaster Unified is the next evolution drawing upon the best elements of previous editions to create a streamlined and consistent game. Rolemaster Spell Law is the spell system of Rolemaster Unified.

Rolemaster Spell Law is the definitive and highly acclaimed magic system. Revised, reformatted, reorga -nized and expanded, Rolemaster Spell Law brings the magic to life in your campaign. Unleash the powers of the elements upon your foes through your mastery of the Essence. Wield the subtler energies of Mentalism to bewilder your enemies and manipulate the minds of your rivals. Call upon your god to heal any wound and blast the undead to ashes.

Spell Law organizes several thousand spells into multiple spell lists forming the Realms of Essence, Channeling and Mentalism. Spell lists are further characterized into the Open, Closed, Evil and Base categories. The special -ist spell lists of all the spell using professions introduced in Rolemaster Core Law are in Rolemaster Spell Law. All spell lists contain a complete set of spells from 1st to 20th level plus epic 25th, 30th, 35th, 40th, and 50th level effects.

Spell Law contains the rules for magic and spell casting. It provides rules for characters to learn new spells and even research whole new spell lists. Ritual magic is presented as an alternative mechanism of achieving mag -ical effects. Finally Spell Law provides comprehensive explanations on how to handle the more complex areas of magical effects such as portents, healing, summoning, illusions, invisibility and more.
