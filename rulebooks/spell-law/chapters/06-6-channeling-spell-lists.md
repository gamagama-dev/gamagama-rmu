Note : All 'Wall' spells on this list (except Wall of Force and Shadow Wall ) require that at least 1 cubic foot of the material of which the wall consists be within 50' of the caster. Wall ma -terial will generally match that of 'model' material (e.g., if the local rock is limestone, a Wall of Stone will also be limestone). See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

  

1. Shadow Wall I - Creates a black, insubstantial wall up to 20'x20'x1" that light cannot pass into or through (i.e., it does not hinder movement, but it blocks vision). Note that this pro -vides Full Soft Cover (see RMCL , Section 9.6). This will not block Darkvision, which does not require light to function.
2.  Airwall -  Creates  a  wall  of  dense  churning  air  up  to 10'x10'x3'. This wall requires 1 AP to cross, the pace of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by one (e.g, a Run going in would be a Jog coming out), and attacks through the wall suffer a -50 penalty.
3. Shadow Wall II - As Shadow Wall I , except for duration.
4. Waterwall - Creates a wall of water up to 10'x10'x1'. This wall requires 2 AP to cross, the pace of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by two (e.g, a Run going in would be a Walk pace coming out) to a minimum of a Walk, and attacks through the wall suffer a -80 penalty.
5. Woodwall - Creates a wall of wood up to 10'x20'x2". It can be burned through or chopped through or toppled if one end is not against a wall.
6. Enhance Lock - Target lock becomes harder to pick or to force, giving a -20 penalty to any attempt to do so. Note that this will give a lock an RR against Heaven's Key .
7. Earthwall - Creates a wall of packed earth up to 10'x10'x (3' at base, 1' at top); it can be dug through only (20 man-rounds at top).
8. Icewall I - Creates a wall of ice up to 10'x10'x (2' at base, 1' at top); it can be melted through or chipped through or toppled if not against a wall.
9.  Sacred  Gate  I -  Creates  a  sanctified  entryway  that  will attempt to prevent 'unholy' things from passing through the gate. The gate is defined by a closed loop that is either free -standing or at an entrance/exit point. A pair of pillars does not define a gate, because the top is open. Putting a crosspiece that connects that  pair  of  pillars  would  close  the  loop  and  allow that to become a Sacred Gate. The gate does not need to have straight  sides;  a  cave  mouth  could  become  a  Sacred  Gate. There is no size limit; the Gateway Arch in St. Louis could be made into a Sacred Gate. When an unholy being tries to pass through the Sacred Gate, it must make an RR. If it fails, then it takes an A Holy critical and is unable to pass through. If  it  succeeds,  it  passes  through  the  gateway  and  the  Sacred Gate spell is dispelled. If the Sacred Gate ever ceases to be a closed loop (e.g., the crosspiece falls off the pillars, leaving the top unconnected), the spell ends. It may also be canceled or dispelled normally.
10. Barrier Pit - Opens a pit (up to 500 cubic feet in stone; 1000 cubic feet in earth or ice). The entire pit must be within 50' of caster and the pit can only be opened on a horizontal surface with an incline of less than 45°.
11. Airwall True - As Airwall , except has a set duration of 1 min/level and does not require concentration.
12.  Stonewall -  Creates  a  wall  of  non-precious  stone  up  to 10'x10'x1'; it can be chipped through or toppled if not against a wall.
13. Waterwall True - As Waterwall ,  except caster need not concentrate and the duration is 1 minute per level.
14. Sacred Gate II - As Sacred Gate I , except for duration and it does a B Holy critical.
15. Woodwall True - As Woodwall ,  except  duration  is  per -manent.
16. Heaven's Key - Unlocks one lock without triggering any associated traps. There is no chance of failure (other than nor -mal spell failure), unless the lock has an RR.
17.  Earthwall True - As Earthwall ,  except  duration  is  per -manent.
18. Icewall II - As Icewall I , except size is up to 20'x20'x(4' at base, 2' at top).
19. Sacred Gate III - As Sacred Gate I , except for duration and it does a C Holy critical.
20. Stonewall True - As Stonewall , except duration is perma -nent and dimensions may be up to 20'x20'x1'.
25. Meld Walls - Fuses touching walls (seam can be up to 20' long) or fuses a section of stone blocks (up to 100 cubic feet).
30. Curved Wall - As any one of the lower level 'wall' Spells on this list, except the wall can be curved up to a semicircle.
35. Sacred Gate IV - As Sacred Gate I, except for duration and it does a D Holy critical.
40. Sacred Gate Tru e - As Sacred Gate I , except for duration and it does an E Holy critical.
50. Wall of Force - Creates a transparent wall of 'force' that is  absolutely  impassable  by  anyone  or  anything.  It  is  up  to 10'x20'x1".

Note :  Spells that involve teleportation are normally quite noisy and difficult to silence. Air is being pushed about in a manner not unlike a thunderclap. Amount of noise depends on the size of the object tele -ported.

  

1. Stamina - Target gains a bonus of +30 for any Endurance rolls due to movement.
2. Edgewalking - Target can walk along narrow edges (down to 2" wide) that can support his weight. Maneuver rolls are not normally required.
3. Icewalking - Target can walk along slick and/or wet surfaces as if on dry, secure footing.
4.  Limbwalking -  Target  can  walk  along  tree  limbs  as  if  on  level ground.
5. Stonewalking - Target can walk on stone surfaces angled up to 60° as if on level ground.
6. Waterwalking - Target can walk on water as if on level dry ground. Water need not be perfectly still, but must be fairly calm.
7. Merging Organic - Target can merge into any organic mate -rial (alive or dead). While merged, target cannot move, perceive, or  cast  spells.  When  the  target  emerges  from  the  material,  it  is possible to emerge from any side or face of the material, although this is limited to moving 'through' no more than the target's own body size plus two feet worth of material. The target can exit at any time up to the end of spell duration (at which time the target automatically emerges at the entrance point).
8. Store Sanctuary - Caster 'stores' a location for use with spells lat -er on this list. While casting this spell, the caster must meditate for one hour in the location that will be stored. The caster can only have one sanctuary stored at a time. As long as this location remains 'stored', it will detect as a magical (i.e., 'holy') place.

13.  Returning  I -  Caster  may  return  (as  a  teleport)  to  the  caster's stored sanctuary (from Store Sanctuary ) so long as the sanctuary is no more than 1 mile away.
14. Icerunning - Target can walk or run along slick and/or wet surfac -es as if on dry, secure footing.
15. Great Merging Organic - As Merging Organic , except target can turn within the material and can perceive the outside world if within 6" of the surface.
16. Returning V - As Returning I , except the sanctuary can be up to 5 miles away.
17. Skywalking - As Airwalking , except target can walk when winds do not exceed twice the caster's level in miles per hour (i.e., when cast by a 20th level character, the target can walk in winds up to 40 mph). Wind does affect the target's movement.
18. Airrunning - As Airwalking , except target can run.
19. Returning X - As Returning I , except the sanctuary can be up to 10 miles away.
20. Merging Organic True - As Great Merging Organic , except tar -get may use self-targeted spells while merged.
25. Airrunning True - As Airrunning ,  except  target  can  run  up  to thrice the normal speed (Running pace) on calm air without expending energy. This pace may be retained without any danger of Endurance checks related to movement during the duration.
30. Word of Return * - As Returning , except spell is instantaneous and the sanctuary can be up to 10 miles per level away.
35. Skyrunning - As Skywalking , except target can move at up to a running pace (three times walking speed), without it being any more fatiguing than walking.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Beast Lore - Caster learns nature, value, and history of one animal.
2. Plant Lore - Caster learns nature, value, and history of one plant (that is not a magical herb).
3.  Herb Lore - Caster can understand the nature, origin, value,  and  use  of  any  magical  herb.  If  the  plant  is  not  a magical herb, no information will be related.
4. Fungal Lore -  Caster learns nature, value, and history of one fungus .
5. Stone Lore - Caster learns the nature, history, and origin of any one stone.
6.  Speed  Growth -  Caster  can  increase  speed  of  growth for any one species of plant within a 10' radius by ten times normal growth rate.
7.  Animal  Tongues -  Allows  caster  to  understand  and 'speak' the language of any one animal species.
8. Water Lore - Caster learns the nature, value, origin, and eventual destination or outflow of one body of fresh water.
9. Animal Mastery I - Allows caster to control the actions of any 1 animal.
10. Nature's Awareness I - Allows caster to monitor animate activity in the area (e.g., the caster will be aware of

movements, subtle and overt). Caster cannot move while concentrating.  Caster  does  not  receive  a  picture  of  what is  moving, just an awareness of the movement. This will allow distinguishing general size and shape of a moving ob -ject. Someone staying still, but breathing, will be detected, but only a very general idea of size would be determinable.

14. Plant Control I - Caster can control the automatic and/ or mental processes of any one plant. Caster can also control the plant's movements; this does not allow movement beyond normal allowances. If cast daily, this can be used to direct a plant's growth into specific unusual shapes, so long as these would be naturally possible.
15. Stonespeech - Caster can communicate with any one stone if it possesses any mental qualities (e.g., caster could speak to a holy stone which possesses some sort of intelli -gence).
16. Herb Production - Caster can grow an herb to sudden maturity by planting the proper seed; the herb is sterile and the growth takes 1-10 rnds.
17.  Fungal  Tongues -  Allows  caster  to  understand  and 'speak' the language of one species of fungus.
18. Animal Mastery V - As Animal Mastery I , except cast -er can control up to five animals.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Speech I - Target is able to communicate basic ideas in a specific language (e.g., hungry, thirsty, bathroom, peace, etc.); equivalent to skill rank 2.
2. Quiet I - Creates a 1'R area into and out of which sound cannot travel. As discussed in Section 10.17, this spell can be cast on an individual target, which the spell will then fol -low; this target gains +25 to Stalking attempts, but likewise automatically fails any Perception attempts based on hear -ing alone and suffers a -50 to Perception rolls where hearing is a factor (e.g., to detect someone Stalking the target). Note that this does not interfere with spell-casting (the target can still  speak, even yell, the sound is simply unable to leave the radius of the Quiet - certain spells like Ultrasonics may have their range limited to the interior of the Quiet radius, however).
3. Tongues I - Caster is able to communicate basic ideas in a specific language (e.g., hungry, thirsty, bathroom, peace, etc.); equivalent to skill rank 2.
4.  Sound Analysis - Caster learns the origin and signifi -cance of any one sound that the caster has heard in the last minute.
5. Soundwall I -  Creates a plane (up to 20'x20') through which sound will not pass.
6. Speech II - As Speech I , except target can communicate more complex concepts, although there is a good chance of misinterpretations; equivalent to skill rank 4.
7. Sphere of Silence I - As Quiet I , except radius is 10'.
8. Quiet III - As Quiet I , except 3 targets can be affected.
9. Tongues II - As Tongues I ,  except caster can commu -nicate  more  complex  concepts,  although  there  is  a  good chance of misinterpretations; equivalent to skill rank 4.

10. Soundwall VI - As Soundwall I , except six such walls are created; each Soundwall must be connected to at least one other Soundwall .

11. Quiet V - As Quiet I , except 5 targets may be affected.
12. Prayer Call - Creates a wordless sound (may resemble a human voice, it just cannot transmit words) that can be heard only by members of the caster's faith. Sound will not have any direct effects, but may serve as a signal and as the spell name implies, it is often used as a signal to assemble for religious services.
13. Sphere of Silence V - As Sphere of Silence I ,  except radius is 50'.
14. Golden Voice - Caster's voice is made more pleasant and suitable for whatever task it is put to. The caster gains a +20 bonus to any vocal tasks (singing, oratory, etc.).
15. Speech III - As Speech I ,  except target is reasonably fluent in the language. Target's accent is imperfect, but there is  only  a  slight  chance  of  misinterpretation; equivalent to skill rank 6.

16. Dialect - Caster can speak a language he already knows in any regional or subcultural dialect, accent, and/or slang as if that form was his normal way of speaking.

17. Sounding V - Target's voice carries five times as far as normal.
18. Babel - Anyone speaking within the area of effect has his words scrabbled into nonsense; anyone hearing speech within the area of effect hears the words as nonsense. The only way two individuals within the area of effect can com -municate through speech is if they both make their RRs.
19. Tongues III - As Tongues I ,  except  caster  is  reason -ably fluent in the language. Caster's accent is imperfect, but there is only a slight chance of misinterpretation; equivalent to skill rank 6.
20. Sphere of Silence X - As Sphere of Silence I ,  except radius is 100'.
25. Mass Soundwalls - As Soundwall V ,  except as many Soundwalls as the caster's level can be created.
30. Mass Quiet - As Quiet I , except as many targets as the caster's level can be affected.
35. Speech True - As Speech III , except target speaks the specified language like a native and the caster does not need to concentrate (duration is 1 min/level). Skill is equivalent to skill rank 8.
40. True Silence -  No sound can exist within the area of effect. It may be targeted on one being as its center, and if that being fails an RR, the radius of effect will travel with that being.
50. Tongues True - As Tongues I , except caster speaks the specified language like a native (equivalent to skill rank 8) and the duration is 10 minutes/level.

Curses are not affected by regular dispelling. See Section 10.2 for dealing with curses.

1. Protection I - Target gains a bonus of +5 to RRs against spells and a bonus of +5 to DB against elemental attacks.
2. Cancel Channeling * - When the caster is a target of a spell from  the  Realm  of  Channeling,  the  'incoming'  spell  must  first make an RR before the caster makes an RR. If the 'incoming' spell passes the RR, it may target the caster of this spell normally; otherwise the incoming spell has no effect on this target. Being a 'willing target' does not eliminate this effect, but the caster's own spells do not need to make an RR. Note that the caster is considered to be a target of any spell which includes him in its area of effect or would 'detect' him.
3. Protection Sphere I - As Protection I , except all beings within 10'R of target (sphere moves with target) get the benefits.
4. Cancel Essence * - As Cancel Channelin g, except affects spells from the realm of Essence.
5. Protection II - As Protection I , except bonuses are +10.
6. Cancel Mentalism * - As Cancel Channeling ,  except affects spells from the realm of Mentalism.
7. Protection Sphere II - As Protection Sphere I , except bonuses are +10.
8. Dispel Channeling I - Any active spell from the realm of Chan -neling that is on the target must make an RR. If the spell fails its RR, it is dispelled.
9. Channeling Shield - Creates a shimmering shield in front of the caster: it provides a bonus to the caster's RR or DB of +10 against all frontal Channeling spell attacks on the caster (force and elemental). If the caster takes an instantaneous action to do so, he

<!-- image -->

can 'deflect' one spell attack. This results in adding the caster's ranks in this list to his RR or, for spells that use an attack table, to his DB (in addition to the basic bonus of 10 for having the Shield ). Multiple  deflections  can  be  done  in  a  single  round,  but  each  is a separate instantaneous action (costing 1 AP for every instanta -neous action after the first).

10. Protection III - As Protection I , except bonuses are +15.
11. Essence Shield - As Channeling Shield , except it is effective only against Essence spells.
12. Dispel Essence I - As Dispel Channeling I , except it affects spells of the realm of Essence.
13. Mentalism Shield - As Channeling Shield , except it is effec -tive only against Mentalism spells.
14. Protection IV - As Protection I , except bonuses are +20.
15. Spell Shield II - As Channeling Shield , except it is effective against any two of the three realms.
16. Dispel Mentalism I - As Dispel Channeling I , except it affects spells of the realm of Mentalism.
17. Protection V - As Protection I , except bonuses are +25.
18. Uncurse - Dispels a curse if the curse fails an RR. The curse's level is the level of the caster of the curse. If the curse is not dis -pelled, the caster cannot try again until he has gone up another level of experience.
19. Spell Shield True - As Channeling Shield , except it is effec -tive against all three realms.
20. Channeling Resistance - Target gets +50 to all RRs against Channeling spells.
25. Essence Resistance - Target gets +50 to all RRs against Es -sence spells.
30. Mentalism Resistance - Target gets +50 to all RRs against Mentalism spells.
35. Holy Protection - As Channeling Resistance , except for dura -tion.
40. Joint Resistance - As Channeling Resistance , except is effec -tive against spells from two realms of the caster's choice.
50. Resistance True - As Channeling Resistance , except is effec -tive against all three realms.

Note: All weather generating spells cause weather to gradually form over a period of one minute. In addition, weather generating spells have no effect in areas where there are not normally occurring weather patterns (i.e., in -side buildings, etc.).

Weather Prediction is  based  on  current  conditions.  Natural  evolution  of the weather system produces some uncertainty, which is represented by the 5% chance of error. Magical or divine intervention can alter weather patterns beyond those natural uncertainty parameters and completely void the Weather Prediction (e.g., a 'sunny and clear' prediction is made for the next three days. Later that day, another caster casts a Storm Call in the area. That disturbs local weather patterns and the Weather Prediction must be recast in order to learn what the new weather pattern is likely to produce).

  

1. Living Gauge - Caster may determine air temperature, humidity, baro -metric pressure, and wind speed. One round of concentration is required per piece of information.
2. Rain Prediction - Gives caster a 95% chance of predicting the time and type of rain (or other precipitation) by ±15 minutes over the next 24 hours.
3. Frost Prediction - Gives caster a 95% chance of predicting the high and low temperatures over the next 24 hours.

4. Weather Prediction I - Caster has a 95% chance of correctly predicting time, type, and severity of weather over the next 24 hr period.

5. Rain Deflection * - No rain, snow, sleet, hail, or fog will come closer than an inch from the caster or what the caster is wearing, allowing the caster to pass through a downpour and come out completely dry.

6. Breeze Call - Caster causes a breeze to come forth which will drive out any gaseous matter (clouds, fog, poison gasses, etc.) and subtracts from all missile attacks (-10). Once set, the direction of the breeze will not change.

7. Fog Call - Caster causes fog to arise that obscures nearly all vision in and through the radius; treat as a heavy fog as described in RMCL , Section 15.7.

8. Unfog - Disperses fog within the area of effect. If not all of a fog is dispersed (i.e., the fog covers a greater area than the area of effect for this spell), fog will refill the area of effect, reducing the cleared radius by 10' every 1-5 minutes (depending on the heaviness of the fog and ambient humidity).

9. Calm Water - All water within a 100'R is calmed; waves are cut by 20' in the center and less towards the perimeter. This will negate the effects of currents in the area of effect.

10. Weather Prediction III - As Weather Prediction I , except that caster has a 95% chance of predicting weather over a 3-day period.

11.  Precipitation  Call -  Caster  causes  rain  or  snow  to  fall  (depending on temperature). The precipitation obscures vision into the radius (-25 to Perception) and modifies all missile attacks passing through part of the radius by -25.

12. Weather Watch - Alerts the caster any time that the weather within the area of effect is altered by supernatural means.

13. Weather Prediction V - As Weather Prediction I , except that caster has a 95% chance of predicting weather over a 5-day period.

14. Temperature Control - Caster can adjust the temperature up or down by 18°F (10°C). Once the duration of the spell is over, the temperature will slowly adjust back to the ambient temperature (over the course of an hour).

15.  Wind  Control -  Caster  can  control  the  speed  and  direction  of  the wind. Caster can increase or decrease wind speed by 1 mph per caster level (e.g., if the wind speed is normally 20 mph, a 15th level caster could alter the wind speed to between 5 and 35 mph). By directing the wind against missile attacks the caster can cause a -1 modification for each mph of wind speed. Note that caster can also control the direction of the flow of gases and/or clouds.

16. Dew Call - Caster can summon a dew (or frost, should the temperature be below freezing) the following morning.

17. Water Control - Caster can control water movement. Caster can create magical barriers blocking water flow, but intangible to all else, within the limits of the spell. Caster can also control the flow of surface currents on a large body of water, providing up to 1 mph per caster level of current, which can carry boats or ships along.

18. Clear Skies - Caster can make the skies clear of haze, precipitation, clouds, etc. This spell will not affect the wind.

19. Weather Prediction XXX - As Weather Prediction I , except that cast -er has a 95% chance of predicting weather over a 30-day period.

20. Rain Call - Caster can summon rain of moderate intensity; the rain will obscure short-range vision (-25 to Perception and missile attack out to 100', -75 beyond 100').

25. Sky Call - Caster may use any of the lower level spells on this list, but with the effects covering a one mile radius.

30. Storm Call - Caster may call forth a storm of any type with maximum wind speeds equal to twice caster's level in miles per hour, and intensity according to the caster's desires. Effects will vary according to circum -stance (and the GM's discretion). For example, a 30th level caster could summon a lightning storm with intense rain and constant wind speeds of up to 60 mph: the GM may wish to have random rolls to determine possible lightning strikes vs. exposed targets.

35. Thunderstorm - Caster can cause lightning bolts to strike a region within range, with anyone in the area subject to a 25% chance of being targeted by a lightning bolt during any given round. The results are de -termined on the Lightning Bolt Attack Table, with the OB equal to the caster's ranks in this list. This spell requires that there already be clouds in the sky. Any fumbles are resolved based on the clouds launching the lightning, not the caster.

40. Tornado - Caster creates a tornado. This spell requires a cloudy sky and at least 20 mph winds. The tornado will be 15' in radius and will move 100' randomly each round that the caster does not concentrate. If the caster concentrates, he can control the movement of the tornado (up to 100' per round). The tornado is resolved on living things and structures as a Large Ram Attack with an OB equal to the caster's ranks in this list, with an additional Grapple critical. If the tornado ever gets a 100% 'grapple' on someone, it will pick him up and drop him from a height of 1-100'. The tornado will pick up and toss around small objects, raise dust and water, and the GM should call for breakage checks on any items he thinks may be threatened. Note that range is for initial formation only; tornado may travel any distance from caster once formed.

50. Weather Mastery - Caster may dictate the weather conditions in the area, modifying wind speeds by ±1 mph x level, and setting the level of precipitation, fog, cloud cover etc. Caster may call for shifts in the patterns as he concentrates, but the change will take at least 1 minute.

Note : A flesh wound is also classified as a 'skin &amp; tissue injury'.  Injury  penalties  from  cuts  (i.e.,  wounds  that  also caused  bleeding)  are  likewise  flesh  wounds  and  'skin  &amp; tissue injuries,' and are treated with Flesh Relief or Flesh Healing spells. See RMCL Section 13.1.

See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells (various Relief, Healing, and Healing True spells). While medical treatment of the wound is miraculously immedi -ate, the body will still need a period of recovery before the injury has healed, depending on several factors, including which type of wound-healing spell is used.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Staunch Wound I * - Reduces target's blood loss by up to 1 hit per round. Until the injury is actually treated by some means (e.g.,  Medicine  maneuver or  a Flesh  Relief spell), the target cannot move or be moved without the bleeding resuming. Multiple Staunch Wound , Flowstop , Clotting , or Cut Repair spells may not be cast upon the same wound.
2. Staunch Wound II * - As Staunch Wound I , except the caster may choose one option: reduce the bleeding by an additional 2 hits/round, or cause the wound to clot so that it is only at risk of reopening during the first hour and only if the target engages in activity more vigorous than walking.
3. Poison/Disease Relief - One poison or disease afflict -ing the target is reduced by one level of severity (e.g. from Extreme to Severe, or from Mild to cured), and, in the case of disease, anyone subsequently infected by the target gains a bonus of +20 on their RR.
4. Light Flesh Relief - A flesh wound or skin/tissue injury that  incurs  a  penalty  up  to  -20  is  cleaned,  protected,  and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, and the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll.
5. Limb Preservation ‡ * - Prevents the deterioration of 1 limb (even while severed); also requires the use of Limb Preservation from the Bone, Muscle, and Nerve spell lists.
6. Staunch Wound III * - As Staunch Wound II , except two options may be chosen, including multiple reductions in the amount of bleeding. If the clotting option is selected twice, bleeding is instantly stopped with no danger of re -opening. In addition, one option may be spent to split the effect of the spell between multiple bleeding injuries (e.g., if the reduction will be 3 hits per round, it may be applied to  reduce  bleeding  of  one  wound  by  1  hit  per  round  and another by 2 hits per round).
7. Poison/Disease Resistance - Target receives an addi -tional RR vs either poison or disease, as specified by the caster at the time of casting.
8. Medium Flesh Relief - As Light Flesh Relief , except a wound incurring a penalty up to -40.
9. Staunch Wound IV * - As Staunch Wound III , except three options may be chosen.
10. Severe Flesh Relief - As Medium Flesh Relief , except a wound incurring any penalty.
11. Light Flesh Healing - A flesh wound or skin/tissue injury that incurs a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneu -ver was performed, the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and the recovery period is reduced to hours rather than days.
12. Joining ‡ * - Caster may reattach one severed limb. The Joining spells from the Bone, Muscle, and Nerve spell lists must be cast for the limb to be functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.
13. Staunch Wound V * - As Staunch Wound III , except four options may be chosen.
14.  Medium  Flesh  Healing - As Light  Flesh  Healing , except an injury incurring a penalty up to -40.
15. Staunch Wound VI * - As Staunch Wound III , except five options may be chosen.
16. Undisease - Removes any one disease from the target.
17. Severe Flesh Healing - As Light Flesh Healing , ex -cept an injury incurring any penalty.
18. Unpoison - Removes any one poison from the target.
19. Staunch Wound VIII * - As Staunch Wound III , ex -cept seven options may be chosen.
20. Mass Undisease - Removes all disease from one target/level.
25. Joining True ‡ * - As Joining , except recovery is in -stantaneous.
30. Light Flesh Healing True - As Light Flesh Healing , except the recovery period is reduced to rounds.
35. Mass Unpoison - Removes all poison from one target/ level.
40.  Medium  Flesh  Healing  True -  As Medium  Flesh Healing , except the recovery period is reduced to rounds.
50. Severe Flesh Healing True - As Severe Flesh Healing , except the recovery period is reduced to rounds.

Note : See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells  (various Relief,  Healing, and Healing True spells). While medical treatment of the wound is miraculously im -mediate, the body will still need a period of recovery before the injury has healed, depending on several factors, includ -ing which type of wound-healing spell is used.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Light Cartilage Relief - An injury to cartilage incurring a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effec -tively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, and the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll.
2. Bone Lore - Caster acquires complete understanding of any bone damage, including the tools and methods required for healing. Caster does not receive the skill or power nec -essary to perform the cure, but this diagnostic does provide a +20 bonus to treatment if supervised by the caster. Alter -natively, this spell can be used to identify bones, including the approximate age, species, sex, and in some cases cause of death.
3. Light Bone Relief - As Light Cartilage Relief , except a bone injury.
4. Contraction - Target's bones become flexible, granting +50 to escape maneuvers.

7.  Medium Bone Relief - As Medium Cartilage Relief , except a bone injury.

10.  Severe  Bone  Relief - As Medium Cartilage  Relief , except a bone injury incurring any penalty.

13. Light Cartilage Healing - An injury to cartilage incurring a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as  effectively  as  if  a  successful  Medicine  maneuver  was performed, the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll and the recovery period is reduced to hours rather than days.
14.  Light  Bone  Healing - As Light  Cartilage  Healing , except for a bone injury.

Note : An 'aggressive' action is defined as any action with the in -tent to directly harm any individual(s). Actions that result in harm indirectly to individuals are not 'aggressive'. Pulling the lever on the wall to drop an individual into a pit is an aggressive action (the action directly resulted in the harm). Running away to get help is not an aggressive action.

Note :  See  Section 10.16 for information on interpreta -tion of 'path'.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Orientation * - Caster knows which way is up and where  the  cardinal  directions  (north,  east,  south,  and west) lie.
2. Guess * - When faced with a choice about which the caster has little or no information (e.g., which corridor leads to the wine cellar), the caster may cast this spell and  the  Gamemaster  will  determine  which  choice  the caster  actually  makes,  biasing  the  choice  favorably  by 25% (e.g., if there are two choices, roll 1-100: correct on  26-100,  incorrect  on  01-25).  The  caster  must  have a limited number of options (i.e., finite and countable). After the spell is  cast,  the  caster  may  not  cast  another Guess for the same information until his experience level has increased.
3. Pathfinding I -  Caster learns the location(s) of any 'path(s)'  within  100';  gives  the  nearest  point  on  each path, but not the path's course.
4.  Guidance -  Caster  is  subtly  directed  (by  hints  and clues) towards a specific destination (within 100'/lvl) by guidance from the caster's deity. The exact form of the guidance may vary from deity to deity (e.g., a deity of water might leave hints in the rocks of a stream, etc.). For the duration of this spell, the caster must concentrate on following the guidance to perceive the clues.
5. Location I - Gives the direction and distance to any specific object or place with which the caster is familiar or has had described in detail. The caster must have the dimensions of the object exact within 10% of actual size and know at least two other attributes that make the item

<!-- image -->

unique  (e.g.,  color,  texture,  weight,  etc.)  within  range of the spell. Note that sometimes the caster must know more than two other attributes to make the item unique, although the Tag spells allow one to shortcut this process.

6.  Pathfinding III - As Pathfinding I ,  except  range  is 300'.
7. Tag I - Caster places a distinctive 'tag' on the aura of a person or item, which will qualify as a unique descriptive marker for purposes of Location (e.g.,  the  caster could cast Tag I on a common coin and Location would be able to pick it out amongst all the various similar coins).
8. Location III - As Location I , except range is 300'.
9. Pathfinding V - As Pathfinding I , except range is 500'.
10. Location V - As Location I , except range is 500'.
11.  Memory's  Path -  Caster  can  remember  an  exact route that  the  caster  has  previously  traveled  regardless of  whether  or  not  the  original  journey  was  made  with the caster's normal sensory abilities active (e.g., a 12th level caster could remember the course of 12 hours of a trip even if blindfolded during that time). To be effective, this spell must be cast within one month of the journey.
12. Far Pathfinding I - As Pathfinding I , except range is 1 mile.
13. Divine Guidance - As Guidance ,  except  the  form of the guidance is that of an animal companion sent by the deity. The caster can follow the animal to a specific destination.
14. Tag II - As Tag I , except for duration.
15. Find Item I - Caster can locate any 1 object the cast -er can describe, if indeed it exists and is in range (e.g., caster could describe a type of mace he had never seen or heard of). Description does not need to be unique. If item description  is  not  unique,  the  spell  locates  the  nearest item matching the description.

16. Far Location - As Location I , except range is 1 mile.

17. Far Pathfinding X - As Pathfinding I , except range is 10 miles.
18. Find Item III - As Find Item I , except range is 300'.
19. Tag III - As Tag I , except for duration.
20. Lord Location - As Location I , except range is 20 miles.
25. Pathfinding True - As Pathfinding I ,  except range is 1 mile/level and exact routes within the range are as -certained.
30.  Location True - As Location I ,  except  range  is  1 mile/level.
35. Tag IV - As Tag I , except for duration.
40. Find Person - As Location True ,  except it locates a person. Caster must still be able to provide a unique description.
50. Find Item True - As Find Item I ,  except range is 100'/level.

Note :  This  list  may  be  learned  by  'Evil'  Channeling  users  as 'Dark Lore', in which case just reverse the 'Light'/'Dark' and 'White'/'Black' Lore spells.  (E.g.,  if  one  learns  the  Dark  Lore list, the 17th level spell is Dark Lore III and works on 'unholy' rather than 'holy' items.)

See Section 10.4 for more about detection spells.

14. Gray Lore I - As Light Lore I , except caster can ascertain the origin point and nature of any one item that is neither holy nor unholy in nature.
15. Emotion Analysis - As Hate Analysis , except caster can deter -mine the nature and origin of any extreme emotion(s) in the target.
16.  Decipher Text -  Caster  can  read  any  text  (as  if  possessing eight  ranks  in  the  appropriate  written  language),  although  this spell  does  not  assist  in  understanding  cultural  context,  cultural references, implications, etc.
17. Light Lore III - As Light Lore I ,  except that caster can as -certain the origin point and nature of any three 'holy items' or caster can determine the age, origin point, name of the creator, and nature of any one 'holy item.' Caster also learns item's specific capabilities.

1. Select Mount - Creates a bond between the caster and an animal, making the animal the caster's 'mount' for the purposes of other spells on this list.

2.  Call  Mount -  Caster  telepathically  summons  his mount, which will come to him as quickly as possible.
3. Riding I - Caster gains a +5 bonus to his Riding skill.
4. Augment  Mount  I -  The  next  maneuver  by  the mount receives a +20 bonus.
5. One Spirit - Caster and mount make RRs using the higher of their two levels and the higher of their RR bonuses (e.g., if the mount has the higher level and the caster has the better RR bonus, they get the benefit of both).
6. Riding II - As Riding I , except bonus is +10.
7. Armor Mount I - Mount gains the benefits of AT 4,  but  without  any  encumbrance  or  armor  penalties since no armor is actually worn. This provides full suit coverage (i.e., treat the mount as having limb armor and a helm).
8. Select Exotic Mount - As Select Mount , except that the target may be any rideable animal or other creature that the GM considers a suitable mount (e.g., the GM may wish to allow use of this list  with  a  hippogriff mount).
9. Riding III - As Riding I , except bonus is +15.
10.  Call  Mount  True - As Call  Mount ,  except  for range.
11. Augment Mount II - As Augment Mount I , except bonus is +40.
12. Riding IV - As Riding I , except bonus is +20.
13. Heal Mount I - Restores all lost hits and treats any Light injuries (penalties up to -20) suffered by the mount. Recovery time for injuries takes normal time as described in RMCL Chapter 13.
14. Armor Mount II - As Armor Mount I , except AT is 7.

16. Riding V - As Riding I , except bonus is +25.
17. Augment Mount III - As Augment Mount I , ex -cept bonus is +60.
18. Heal Mount II - As Heal Mount I , except treats Medium injuries (penalties up to -40) as well. Recov -ery time is as described in RMCL , but convert days to hours.
19. Armor Mount III - As Armor Mount I ,  except AT is 10.
20. Riding VI - As Riding I , except bonus is +30.
25. One Soul True - As One Soul , except it also has the effect that any Utility spells cast on the caster of this spell also affect the mount.
30. Augment Mount True - As Augment Mount I , except bonus is +100.
35. Heal Mount True - As Heal Mount I , except treats all injury short of death (will heal fatal damage so long as mount is still alive). Recovery time is as described in RMCL , but convert days to minutes.
40. One Body - Caster and mount move as one, giv -ing them both a +25 OB to all physical attacks (i.e., not  spell)  and  +10  DB  to  attacks  of  which  they  are aware. This bonus does not apply if one of the duo is no longer fully aware and active (e.g., when one of them is stunned).
50.  Tireless  Mount -  During  the  duration  of  this spell, the mount needs no rest, sleep, food, or water. Its hunger and thirst do not grow, nor can it experience fatigue  (i.e.,  it  automatically  makes  any  Endurance rolls).  Hunger,  thirst,  and  tiredness  will  begin  to  in -crease normally after the end of this spell.

1. Diagnosis - Diagnoses target's wounds, injuries, and dis -eases allowing a +20 bonus to all Medicine maneuvers made by the caster to treat the target's diagnosed condition(s). Caster can take a round to advise someone else on treating the target, providing a +10 bonus to treat the target.
2.  Infertility - Target becomes completely infertile for the spell's duration.
3. Light Organ Relief - An injury to an organ (e.g. eye, ear, liver but not the brain or nerves) incurring a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, and the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll.
4. Distraction - Target is at -30 for all actions.
5. Limb Preservation ‡ * - Allows caster to prevent deterioration of one limb (even while severed); requires use of the Blood, Bone, and Muscle Limb Preservation spells as well.
6.  Medium Organ Relief - As Light Organ Relief ,  but  an injury incurring a penalty up to -40. This can be used to cure most causes of infertility (if the requisite organs are still pres -ent).
7. Sense Enhancement - One of target's natural senses (e.g. vision, hearing, touch) is honed and perfected for the duration. Perception maneuvers based exclusively on that sense gain a +20 bonus, while Perception that involves that sense and others gain a +10 bonus.
8. Restart Heart - Target's heart will start beating after hav -ing stopped. This does not repair any heart disease or damage that caused the initial stoppage.
9. Light Nerve Relief - An injury to the brain or nerves in -curring a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was per -formed, and the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll.
10. Piercing Gaze - Target can see twice as far through fog, mist,  water,  or  other  semi-transparent  substances  that  would otherwise reduce their range of vision.
11. Severe Organ Relief - As Light Organ Relief , but an in -jury incurring any penalty.
12. Joining ‡ * - Caster may reattach one severed limb. The Joining spell from the Bone, Blood, and Muscle spell lists must be cast for the limb to be functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.
13. Light Organ Healing - An injury to an organ incurring a penalty up to -20 is treated as effectively as if a successful Medicine  maneuver  was  performed,  the  target  receives  +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
14. Coma Recovery - Target comes out of a coma or uncon -sciousness caused by injury, disease, poison, spell, or spell fail -ure. Process takes 1-10 hours and target is at -50 to Endurance rolls for 1-10 days.
15. Medium Organ Healing - As Light Organ Healing , ex -cept an injury incurring a penalty up to -40.
16. Light Nerve Healing - An injury to the brain or nerves incurring a penalty up to -20 is treated as effectively as if a suc -cessful Medicine maneuver was performed, the target receives +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
17.  Sense  Restoration  True -    Target  regains  function  in one sensory organ, so long as that sensory organ has not been completely destroyed (in which case Organ Regeneration is required). Recovery time is instantaneous.
18. Severe Organ Healing - As Severe Organ Relief , except the recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
19. Paralysis Cures - Caster can cure any paralysis problem. The recovery time is 1-10 days. Treat as -100 injury for prog -ress of recovery.
20. Medium Nerve Healing - As Light Nerve Healing , ex -cept an injury incurring a penalty up to -40.
25. Joining True ‡ * - As Joining , except recovery is instan -taneous.
30. Severe Nerve Healing - As Light Nerve Healing , except an injury incurring any penalty.
35.  Organ Regeneration - Target  will  regenerate  any  one organ (external or internal) other than the brain or nerves. The recovery time is 1-10 hours.

Note : A symbol is permanent unless destroyed by Unsymbol or  the stone it is placed upon is moved. Symbols are not affected by Dispel spells.

The precise size of a Symbol may vary. Suggested sizes range from 3"x3" to 1'x1'.

For spells with a duration of Concentration, treat it as 1 round/level when cast by a Symbol.

If a spell list skill bonus is used in the resolution of a spell, use the bonus for a number of ranks equal to the level of the spell (e.g., the bonus for a 7th level spell would be +35).

When a spell from a Symbol requires an RR, assume an SCR of 50.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Analyze Symbol - Caster learns what spell is emplaced within one Symbol within 50'. The Symbol will not be triggered (unless specifi -cally created to be triggered by an Analyze Symbol spell).
2. Spell Prime - This spell 'primes' the next spell cast by the caster - that spell is treated as if it were instantaneous. The PP cost of this spell is equal to the highest level that the caster wants to have primed. For example, if the caster wants any fourth (or lower) level spell to be treated as instantaneous, this spell will cost 4 PP. In addition, when casting this spell, the caster must pray for one minute per PP spent (e.g., if the caster spends 4 PP on this spell, he must pray for 4 minutes before the spell is completed.) The effects of this spell end when the caster casts his next spell (even if the next spell does not benefit from this spell due to being of too high a level or already an instantaneous spell).
3. Unsymbol I - Caster can remove one Symbol I (an emplaced 1st level spell). The Symbol's RR is based on the level of the spell in the Symbol spell (the target level) and the level of the Unsymbol spell (the attack level).
4.  Symbol I -  Caster  can  emplace  one  1st  level  spell  on  an  inani -mate, non-mobile slab of stone (block, piece, etc.) weighing at least 2,000 pounds. Only one Symbol may be placed on each continuous slab. The stone may not be moved appreciably without destroying the Symbol. Within one minute, the spell to be emplaced must also be

cast (within 10'). A Symbol can be triggered (once per day) by one of the following (decided by caster): time period, specified movements, specified sounds, touch, reading, violent actions in the area, etc. The triggering  range  is  normally  the  range  of  the  emplaced  spell  or  10' (whichever is greater). The effective level of the embedded spell (for the purposes of RRs, Duration, etc.) is the level of the highest level spell the Symbol can hold. For example, a first level spell placed in a Symbol using Symbol I is cast at 1st level (regardless of the level of the original caster), while a first level spell place using Symbol VII is cast at 7th level. If the spell is an elemental attack, the OB is normally +0. However, the attack can be focused on a location (as opposed to simply the person who triggers the symbol); in this case, the OB is +50. The Symbol is usually visible, but is only required to be visible if reading is the trigger.

5. Recharge Symbol - This spell must be cast on a Symbol that has already been triggered this day. Once this spell is cast on the Symbol, the Symbol is recharged and can be triggered again. A given caster cannot recharge the same Symbol more than once per day, but one caster may recharge any number of Symbols and a Symbol may be recharged by multiple casters.
6.  Unsymbol II - As Unsymbol I ,  except a Symbol I-II may be removed.
7. Symbol II - As Symbol I , except a 1st-2nd level spell may be em -placed.
8.  Unsymbol V - As Unsymbol I ,  except  a Symbol I-V may be removed.

Note :  For  the Sanctuary and Sanctuary's  Return spells,  normal  encum -brance rules apply (see Section 10.15).

Note that the spells on this list may vary in appearance or usage based upon the nature  of  the  deity  the  caster  serves.  GMs  should  feel  free  to replace some of the spells above for spells more appropriate to the deity. For example, a god(dess) of fire might have several spells replaced with spells adapted from the Magician's Fire Law list.

The GM should be careful and clear when defining 'alignment' for the Holy Shout spell. Targets should include all folk who are not specifically following the caster's religion (and thus it might include some allies). De -pending on the state of theology in game world, this might mean that to avoid the effects one needs to worship the caster's deity, or it might merely require that a deity of the same mythos be followed (e.g., in a world using Greek, Norse, Indian, Chinese, and Celtic gods, a devotee of Zeus might be considered of the same 'alignment' as a priest of Poseidon).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Create Holy Water - When this spell is cast, up to four fluid ounces of clean, clear water are transformed into holy water. This spell takes one hour  to  cast.  If  the  water  is  not  placed  into  a  clean  receptacle,  its  holy nature is ruined.

2. Calming - Caster points his arm (elbow locked and fist clenched) at the target and channels raw power from his power source (usually a deity). The target of the spell may take no aggressive/offensive action, and will only fight if attacked.

3. Channels I * - When this spell is cast, the 1st level spell that the caster begins to cast (or prepare) the next round will be 'channeled' to another spell user of the Channeling realm. The 'channeled' spell is transmitted to the other spell user when it would normally take effect, and must be used by the receiving spell user immediately or delayed as described in Section 4.8 (treating the receiving spell user as the caster of the spell). All normal restrictions on the transmitted spell apply. The caster of the Channels spell must be able  to  see  the  receiver  or  know  exactly  where  the  receiver  is (direction and distance or specific place). The receiver must know exactly when the spell is coming (but need not know what the spell sent is). For example, if a Cleric was at a certain altar at a certain time (midnight of full moon) ready to receive a spell; then another spell user (or deity) who knew this could use Channels I to send a spell to that Cleric. Because the spell is passed through the aura of the receiving character, the spell is cast at the level of the receiving character (including any level-based parameters).

4. Power Channel I * - As Channels I , except instead of sending a spell, the caster may send up to 1 PP/level to the other spell user (who need not use them right away). If the PP sent put the receiver over his normal PP maximum, excess PP are lost and the receiving individual suffers one hit of damage per PP in excess of his maximum.

5. Stunning - As Calming , except target is stunned (-50).

6. Channels III * - As Channels I ,  except a 1st-3rd level spell may be transmitted.

7. Power Channel II * - As Channels I, except the caster can send up to 2 PP/level.

8. Golden Slumbers - As Stunning , except target falls into a deep sleep. The spell duration of this sleep is magical (and the target cannot be awak -ened in any normal fashion). After this magical sleep, the target may be awakened normally, but if undisturbed, the target will sleep for a normal length sleep period (eight hours for humans).

9. Create Holy Water True - As Create Holy Water , except that the holy water is simply created without the need for clean water to transform.

10. Channels V * - As Channels I ,  except a 1st-5th level spell may be transmitted.

11. Blinding Channel - As Stunning , except target is blinded for 1 minute per 5 failure.

12. Holy Smite - [RR Mod: -20] Target takes a B Holy critical.

13. Channels VIII * - As Channels I , except a 1st-8th level spell may be transmitted.

14. Absolution - [RR Mod: -20] Target's 'soul' is torn from the target's body (or other physical location if the soul is otherwise housed); it remains in whatever place 'souls' go for 1 week/10 failure. The soul can be re -turned early only through Lifegiving or Reuniting . Target is unconscious until soul is restored; even subconscious activity (i.e., healing, etc.) suffers a -75 penalty.

15. Holy Shout * - All beings not of the caster's own 'alignment' (re -ligious  persuasion)  are  affected. All  targets  failing  to  resist  by  1-40  are stunned (-50) 1 rnd/10 failure; those failing by more than 40 are uncon -scious for 1 rnd/5 failure.

16.  Item Returning - Target item (weighing no more than 10 pounds) will return to a designated location. This spell has two possible durations (determined at the time of casting). The caster may send (i.e., teleport) the target item to a designated location at the time of casting (with an instanta -neous duration), or the caster can designate that the target item will return to the caster when the possessor of the item has completed a specific task (specified at the time of casting).

17. Channels X * - As Channels I , except a 1st-10th level spell may be transmitted.

18. Sanctuary * - Caster is returned to a predefined place (this is a type of teleportation). Caster must have lived in the place for 30 days (meditating 16 hours each day) to define it as the caster's 'sanctuary'. Only one such place may be defined at any one time; to change it, the new place must be defined as above.

19. Item Rereturning - As Item Returning , except object will stay at the designated location (set at the time of casting) for up to 1 round per level. At the end of this time, the object will go back to where it 'returned' from.

20. Absolution Pure - [RR Mod: -20] As Absolution ,  except the 'soul' can only be brought back through Lifegiving or Reuniting .

25.  Sanctuary's  Return * -  For  up  to  1  round/level  after  having  used Sanctuary , the caster may cast this spell and be returned to within 20' of the point at which the Sanctuary spell was cast.

30. Lord Channels * - As Channels I , except a 1st-20th level spell may be transmitted.

35. Holy Smite True - [RR Mod: -20] Target takes an E Holy critical.

40. Channels True * - As Channels I , except there is no limit on the level of spell that may be transmitted.

50.  Holy  Bridge -  Opens  a  direct  channel  to  the  caster's  deity;  results depend on the deity's personality, motives, and powers. Any spell the deity can cast may be transmitted through the gate.

  

1. Guess * - When faced with a choice about which the caster has little or no information (e.g., which corridor leads to the wine cellar), the caster may cast this spell and the Gamemaster will determine which choice the caster actually makes, biasing the choice favorably by 25% (e.g., if there are two choices, roll 1-100: correct on 26-100, incorrect on 01-25). The caster must have a limited number of op -tions (i.e., finite and countable). After the spell is cast, the caster may not cast another Guess for the same information until his experience level has increased.

2.  Faithful  Tongue -  Caster  can  speak  and  understand  the  lan -guage(s) of any supernatural entities favorable to his religion with the same fluency as he has in his native language.

3. Intuitions I - Caster gains a vision of what will probably happen in the next minute if the caster takes a specified action.

4. Dream I - Caster has a dream relating to a topic decided upon just before retiring; limited to once per night. The caster must sleep for a normal sleep cycle (minimum of four hours) for this spell to work.

5. Intuitions III - As Intuitions I , except the caster gets to gaze 3 minutes into the future.

6.  Death's Tale -  Caster  gets  a  vision  of  the  events  surrounding the  death  of  any  1  dead  being  through  the  eyes  of  the  deceased, including a view of the killer, if any. Caster must be within 10' of the corpse. Corpse must have died within a number of years equal to the caster's level.

7.  Channel  Opening  I -  Caster  can  open  a  channel  with  any  1 known being the caster is acquainted with. This spell will enable the caster to learn the specific location (direction and distance only) of the other being, making it possible for the caster to use a Channels spell (see Channels list). Note that this spell does not allow any sort of communication, although the target will know that a Channel has been opened to him.

8. Intuitions V - As Intuitions I , except caster gets to gaze 5 minutes into the future.

9. Holy Hands - Caster gains a +50 to his Attunement skill as ap -plied to magic items tied to his religion (i.e., those based in Channel -ing magic and usable by the caster).

11.  Intuitions  X - As Intuitions  I ,  except  caster  gets  to  gaze  10 minutes into the future.

13. Magic Basin I - The target of this spell is a small pool of clear, clean water. The water must be calm (and remain so for the duration of the spell). The caster may designate a topic and a vision will ap -pear in the pool that relates to the topic. This vision normally takes 5-50 rounds. This vision may be seen by anyone looking into the pool.

14. Share Thoughts - Caster can mentally communicate with one other person, who must be a member of the same religion.

15. Channel Opening II - As Channel Opening I , except range is 10 miles per level.

17. Dream V - As Dream I , except the limit is five dreams/night on different topics.

18. Magic Basin II - As Magic Basin I , except up to two topics may be designated (5-50 rounds are required for each vision).

19. Death's Tale True - Caster gets a vision of the events surround -ing  the  death  of  any  1  dead  being  within  10  feet.  Caster  gets  an understanding of the reason(s) the deceased died, exactly who the killer was (if any), and who was ultimately responsible (if anyone). The vision of who is ultimately responsible will be a quick montage of the connections between the killer and the person ultimately re -sponsible. Corpse may be of any age.

20. Commune True - As Commune I , except caster can receive a more detailed answer (e.g., a name or short phrase) to a question involving only one concept.

25. Intuitions True - As Intuitions I , except caster may gaze into the future for a number of minutes equal to the caster's level.

Channel will open to the nearest being matching the description, if any.

35. Channel Opening III - As Channel Opening I , except range is 100 miles per level.

40. Magic Basin True - As Magic Basin I , except up to one topic for every 10 levels (or fraction thereof) of the caster may be designated, and the visions take less objective time (although they will seem as subjectively long to the viewer), requiring only 1 round per vision.

50. High Prayer - Caster receives detailed information on a single topic  question.  This  information  comes  directly  from  the  caster's deity.

  

1. Life Awareness - Caster can detect presence and number of  living  entities  (Tiny  animals  or  larger)  within  the  area  of effect and can concentrate on a different 5'R area each round. Caster  will  be  aware  of  mundane  life,  such  as  insects,  very small animals and plants, but not of their exact number, only general types.
2. Preservation I - Caster can preserve a dead body, prevent -ing decomposition. Preservation can only be used on bodies of living beings that are or were capable of life, it cannot be used to preserve other organic matter.
3.  Heal Life Essence I -  The  cast  can  reduce a stat penalty due to Life Drain by 1. A target can only receive one Heal Life Essence spell per day, and can only have a specific stat affected once per week.
4. Lifekeeping I -  Caster prevents the soul of a target from leaving its body (thus preventing actual death), although the body will continue to take damage (from bleeding or other ef -fects) for the duration. If the body is not capable of sustaining life at the end of the duration, then the soul will depart. This will  prevent  Absolution  of  any  kind,  unless  the Absolution makes a successful RR against this spell.
5. Infuse Life II - Target is infused with a part of the caster's life force. Caster takes a -2 to a stat bonus of his choice, and the target gets a +2 to any stat bonus (which does not have to be the same stat bonus as the caster reduces). The target receives the benefits for the duration of the spell, but the caster's penalty

can only be removed via Heal Life Essence . Each stat can only be under the benefit of a single Infuse Life at a time, although the caster could have several penalties due to multiple Infuse Life spells being cast.

6. Resurrection - Target is temporarily revived by returning the soul to the body for a brief time, regardless of the condition of the body (if body is terribly damaged the target may not be able to take advantage of his brief return to the living).
7. Preservation II - As Preservation I , except for duration.
8. Analyze Life - Caster can analyze a life form he can see or has previously detected with Life Awareness . He understands the nature of the life form (race), its approximate level, and if its life is currently in danger. Caster can analyze one being each round for the duration of the spell (requires Concentration).
9. Sacrifice * - Caster can restore life to a recently dead body (within 1 rnd/lvl) by giving up his own life. The target's soul is returned to his body with no ill effects (although he is still subject to any wounds he had). The caster's soul departs, how -ever this spell also acts as a Preservation II spell on the caster's body. Duration is for the Preservation effect; the other effects are permanent.
10. Heal Life Essence II - As Heal Life Essence I except that a stat penalty can be reduced by 2.
11. Lifekeeping II - As Lifekeeping I , except for duration.
12. Infuse Life IV - As Infuse Life I , except the caster's stat bonus is reduced by 4 and the target's stat bonus is increased by 4.
13. Preservation III - As Preservation I , except for duration.
14. Lifegiving I - Caster can return the soul of a being (that has not been dead for more than 1 min/lvl) to its body. If the body is not capable of sustaining life, then the soul will depart again. The target gets a -15 to all stats (which can be restored via Heal Life Essence ).
15. Heal Life Essence III - As Heal Life Essence I ,  except penalty can be reduced by 3.
16. Lifekeeping III - As Lifekeeping I , except for duration.
17. Infuse Life VI - As Infuse Life I , except caster's stat bonus is reduced by 6 and the target's stat bonus increased by 6.
18. Preservation True - As Preservation I ,  except for dura -tion.
19. Lifegiving II - As Lifegiving I , except body can have been dead for up to 1 day/level.
20. Heal Life Essence V - As Heal Life Essence I except penalty can be reduced by 5.
25. Lifekeeping True - As Lifekeeping I , except for duration.
30. Infuse Life X - As Infuse Life I , except caster's stat bonus is reduced by 10 and the target's stat bonus increased by 10.
35. Lifegiving III - As Lifegiving I , except body can have been dead for up to 1 month/level.
40. Heal Life Essence True - As Heal Life Essence I , except the entire stat penalty is removed.
50. Lifegiving True - As Lifegiving I , except there is no time limit.

Note : Resistance, Prayer, Bless, and Protective Spheres are not cumulative with each other for a single effect, but may be com -bined to include more effects.

The Prayer would not increase the maneuver roll bonus, but would provide a +5 to RRs.

6. Sacred Protection I - Target is protected from physical at -tacks as if armored. Target is granted the benefits of AT 4, but is not encumbered in any way, as he is not actually armored.
7. Resist Spell - Target gains a +30 bonus to his RRs against a specific spell (spells whose name differs only by Roman numer -al are considered the same spell for this purpose, but a 'Lord' or 'True' version is not).

Note : See Creature Law for more information about the undead. The GM may wish to give RR modifications for certain very powerful un -dead. Also, GMs may wish to modify the undead-affecting spells to be more/less powerful when on holy/unholy ground (see Treasure Law ).

A Hybrid spell will  be  affected  by  a Cancel or Dispel spell  that  is effective against either of its hybridized realms.

See Section 10.2 for more on curses and removing them.

  

1. Repel Undead V - Causes up to 5 Undead to flee or disintegrate. Up to five 'points' of Undead may be affected: a 'Class I' Undead counts as  1  point,  a  'Class  II'  Undead  counts  as  2  points,  etc.  'Animated Dead' are treated as 'Class I' Undead but are not entitled to an RR (they automatically disintegrate if the spell does not fail). Otherwise, each target is entitled to an RR: if it fails by 1-50, it will flee (targets that cannot flee remain motionless) for 1 round per 1 failure. If it fails by more than 50, it disintegrates. The RR of any undead creature can be modified by concentrating the effects of the spell on that target: for each additional point of the spell allocated to a target (beyond those normally needed to affect it), that target's RR is modified by -5. Thus Repel Undead V could affect 5 Class I Undead with no RR modifier or 1 Class 1 Undead with an RR modifier of -20 or 1 Class II Undead with an RR modifier of -5 and 2 Class I Undead with no RR modifier or any other combination of targets providing no more than 5 points were allocated. Once an undead has made an RR against a given cast -er's Repel Undead spell, it cannot be affected by a Repel Undead spell from that caster again until one of the following happens: the caster gains a level, the undead is 'killed' and has to reconstitute itself, or the caster converts to a new power source (i.e., changes religion).
2. Cancel Channeling * - When the caster is a target of a spell from the  Realm  of  Channeling,  the  'incoming'  spell  must  first  make  an RR before the caster makes an RR, using the level of this spell as the attacking level and the level of the incoming spell as the defending level. If the 'incoming' spell passes the RR, it may target the caster of this spell normally; otherwise the incoming spell has no effect on this target. Being a 'willing target' does not eliminate this effect, but the caster's own spells do not need to make an RR. Note that the caster is considered to be a target of any spell which includes him in its area of effect or would 'detect' him.
3. Anti-Channels I * - Cancels a Channels I spell being transmitted or received within range. Note that the Channels I spell gets no RR.
4. Neutralize Curse I - [RR Mod: -20] Nullifies a curse for the dura -tion of this spell. The curse is not dispelled and takes effect again once the duration of this spell expires.
5. Anti-Channels III * - As Anti-Channels I , except affects up to a Channels III .
6. Repel Undead IX - As Repel Undead V , except 9 points of undead may be affected.
7. Uncurse - Dispels a curse if the curse fails an RR. The curse's level is the level of the caster of the curse. If the curse is not dispelled, the caster cannot try again until he has gone up another level of experi -ence.
8. Dispel Channeling I - Any active spell from the realm of Chan -neling that is on the target must make an RR. If the spell fails its RR, it is dispelled.
9. Neutralize Curse II - [RR Mod: -20] As Neutralize Curse I , except curse is nullified for one hour per level.
10. Anti-Channels V * - As Anti-Channels I , except affects up to a Channels V .
11.  Repel  Undead  XII - As Repel Undead V ,  except  12  points  of Undead may be affected.
12. Anti-Channels VIII * - As Anti-Channels I , except affects up to a Channels VIII .
13. Lesser Banishment - An entity from another plane (typically a demon) is sent back to whence it came. This spell will affect entities of up to Type (or Grade for elementals) II or up to 10th level if they do not have a 'Type'.
14. Dispel Channeling V - As Dispel Channeling I , except affects up to five targets.
15. Anti-Channels X * - As Anti-Channels I , except affects up to a Channels X .
16.  Repel  Undead  XV - As Repel  Undead V ,  except  15  points  of Undead may be affected.
17.  Greater  Banishment -  As Lesser  Banishment ,  except  affects entities up to Type (or Grade) IV or 20th level if they do not have a 'Type'.
18.  Neutralize  Curse  III -  [RR  Mod:  -20] As Neutralize  Curse  I , except curse is nullified for 1 day/level.
19. Dispel Channeling X - As Dispel Channeling I , except affects up to ten targets.
20.  Lord  Repel  Undead -  As Repel  Undead  V ,  except  this  spell disintegrates  any  one  Undead of Class V or lower automatically or automatically sends a Class VI fleeing for 1 round per caster level.
25. Uncurse True - [RR Mod: -50] As Uncurse ,  except for the RR modification.
30. Anti-Channels True * - As Anti-Channels I except  any  Chan -neled spell can be canceled. Spells channeled with the aid of a Holy Bridge (Cleric Base list, Channels) are not affected.
35. Repel Undead True - As Repel Undead V ,  except a number of points of Undead equal to the caster's level may be affected and if 20 points are applied to any one Undead, the effect is that of Lord Repel Undead on that target.
40.  True  Banishment - As Lesser  Banishment ,  except  affects  any entity short of a god.
50.  Rechanneling -  Once  per  round,  the  caster  can  intercept  one channeled spell that is being transmitted or received within this spell's range and cast that spell himself. The person sending the channeled spell gets an RR (the defending level is that of the caster sending the channeled spell). Alternatively, the caster can intercept channeled PP for his own use. Interception takes no activity. Casting an intercepted spell takes the normal time.

Note : If the creature can understand the caster (e.g. Animal Tongues ), the creature can be controlled through normal communication. Otherwise, control is maintained only through the concentration of the caster.

Spells that involve teleportation are normally quite noisy and difficult to silence. Air is being pushed about in a manner not unlike a thunderclap. Amount of noise depends on the size of the object teleported.

When allowed to choose more than one option on summoning spells, the same option may be chosen more than once. For example, with a Summons III , two options are available. This means that if both options are used for the same thing, then three first-level creatures could be sum -moned, or one third-level creature could be summoned, or one first-level creature could be summoned for four times as long.

Demons  are  assumed  to  be  hostile  beings  of  another  plane  who  are brought into  the  caster's  plane  through  the  use  of  an  elemental  force (one not of the demon's plane). Thus, the demon and caster do not make RRs during the summons. See Creature Law for information on specific demons. While written with Evil spell lists in mind, Section 10.3 may also be useful.

While Summons spells on this list are of type 'U', the creatures sum -moned are automatically considered willing to serve as described.

  

1. Summons I - Caster can instantly summon a first level non-intelligent (i.e., possessing the Animalistic or Mindless flaw) living creature, which appears somewhere within the spell's range. The caster can specify the general type of creature, but exactly what the creature is should be de -termined randomly (e.g., the caster could specify 'four-legged, hoofed' and could get a zebra, horse, camel, etc.). If the creature can understand the caster's communication, the creature can be controlled by normal communication. Otherwise, control is maintained through concentration of the caster. If the creature summoned is used for a task that is not dan -gerous (in its own perception), the duration for this spell is 10 minutes per level. However, if the creature is ever put into a dangerous situation, the duration immediately drops to 1 round per level. At the end of the spell's duration, the summoned creature will disappear back whence it came.

2. Summons II - As Summons I , except the caster chooses one of the following options: a) the level of the summoned creature is increased by one, b) an extra 1st level creature can be summoned, or c) the duration can be doubled. When applying options to the higher level Summons spells, option 'a' can only be applied to one creature at a time (i.e., two 2nd level creatures takes three options: one for the second creature and one each to raise the creatures to 2nd level).

3. Summons III - As Summons II , except two options are chosen.
4. Summons IV - As Summons II , except three options are chosen.
5. Summons V - As Summons II , except four options are chosen.
6. Summons VI - As Summons II , except five options are chosen.
7. Summons VII - As Summons II , except six options are chosen.
8. Summons VIII - As Summons II , except seven options are chosen.
9. Summons X - As Summons II , except nine options are chosen.

10. Demonic Gate I - Caster summons a Type I Demon that appears over the course of 2 rounds; the caster can control it by concentrating. After the caster stops concentrating, the demon will fade out over the course of 2 rounds, attacking the closest being until gone.

11. Summons XV - As Summons II , except fourteen options are chosen.

12. Summon Guard * - Caster can summon (teleport to his location) a single 'guard', who must be a member of an intelligent race, a follower of the caster's own religion, and currently doing service to the summon -er or the summoner's religious institution. Guard must also be within range of the spell when it is cast or it will fail.

13. Lord Summons - As Summons II , except nineteen options are cho -sen.

14. Divine Gate I - As Demonic Gate I , except summons a Type I ex -traplanar being of a non-hostile nature. Control is not possible, though the summoned being will be helpful and will usually do as the caster requests if communication is possible.

15. Demonic Gate II - As Demonic Gate I , except a Type II Demon is summoned.

16. Summon Guards * - As Summon Guard , except one guard can be summoned for every five full levels of the caster (e.g., a 16th level caster could summon three guards).

17. Waiting Summons - As Summons X ,  except it can be delayed up to 1 day/level or until triggered by one of the following (decided by the caster at the time of casting): specified movements, sounds, touch, or ac -tions. Trigger must be such as the caster would be able to sense it if still at the location of the spell effect. At the time of casting, the caster may specify a single task for the creature(s) to perform when it/they arrive(s).

18. Summon Army - Caster sends out a telepathic summons heard by all the faithful within range to gather for a holy war. Response is volun -tary, except for the Paladins of the faith, who must make an RR if they wish to  resist.  Use  of  this  spell  tends  to  be  strictly  monitored  by  the Cleric's superiors, both mortal and divine, so it is best used only when there is a real need.

19. Divine Gate II - As Divine Gate I , except a Type II entity is sum -moned.

20. Demonic Gate III - As Demonic Gate I , except a Type III Demon can be summoned.
25. Mass Summons - As Summons II , except one option per caster level is chosen.

30. Summons True - As Summons I , except caster can summon a spe -cific  type  of  creature  of  a  level  up  to  half  the  caster's  level  for  more lengthy service.

35. Divine Gate III - As Divine Gate I , except a Type III entity is sum -moned.

40. Demonic Gate IV - As Demonic Gate I , except a Type IV Demon can be summoned.

50. Gate - Caster can pull any being through a 'gate' to the caster's location; if the being is intelligent, it must be willing to come. An intel -ligent being will know the religious affiliation of the gating person and a vague idea of the reason and the significance for the 'gate'.

Note : When allowed to choose more than one option on summon -ing spells, the same option may be chosen more than once. For example, with an Animal Summons III , two options are available. This means that if both options are used for the same thing, then three  first-level  creatures  could  be  summoned,  one  third-level creature could be summoned, or one first-level creature could be summoned for four times as long.

See Creature Law for more information on animals. For purposes of this list consider anything in the 'Animals' chapter of Creature Law , and nothing outside that chapter, to be an animal.

While Summons spells on this list are of type 'U', the creatures summoned are automatically considered willing to serve as described.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Animal Sleep I - Puts any animal into a magical sleep.
2. Animal Restoration I - Caster may heal any non-fatal damage in any animal of Small size or smaller.
3. Animal Tongues - Allows caster to understand and 'speak' the language of any one animal species.
4. Animal Sleep III - As Animal Sleep I , except up to 3 animals may be made to sleep.
5. Animal Mastery I - Allows caster to control the actions of any one animal.
6. Animal Location - Caster can locate members of any one species of animal within the area of effect or he can find out what species are in the area.
7. Befriending - All animals within 10' will act friendly toward caster. This does not control the animals.
8. Animal Restoration II - Caster may heal any non-fatal damage in any animal of Medium size or smaller or heal fatal damage in an animal of Small size or smaller.
9. Animal Empathy - Caster can understand and/or visualize the thoughts and emotions of any one animal.
10. Animal Summons I - Caster magically summons a 1st level animal from the surrounding area. The caster can specify the spe -cies of creature or simply a general type, but not a particular indi -vidual. If the animal can understand the caster (e.g., through use of Animal Tongues ), the creature can be controlled through normal communications. Otherwise, control is maintained only through concentration by the caster. If the animal summoned is used for a task that is not dangerous (in the animal's perception), the duration of this spell is 10 minutes per level. However, if the animal is ever put into a dangerous situation, the duration immediately drops to 1 round per level.

11. Animal Mastery III - As Animal Mastery I , except caster can control up to three animals.

12. Animal Summons III - As Animal Summons I ,  except  the caster  chooses two of the following options: a) the  level  of  the summoned creature is increased by one, b) an extra 1st level crea -ture can be summoned, or c) the duration can be doubled.

13. Animal Call - Caster can 'call' any one known, individual an -imal; if it is physically possible, the animal will come to the caster.
14. Animal Reviving I - This spell will return any animal of no more than Small size from the dead. The animal cannot have been dead for more days than its own level plus the caster's level. If this spell is ever cast unsuccessfully on an animal (i.e., if an attempt to cast this spell ends in spell failure), then that animal can never be revived. The animal will be at -100 to all actions for a number of days equal to 20 days per day dead.
15. Call of the Wild - When cast upon any domesticated animal, that animal will return to its 'wild' state. The animal will have no difficulty in adapting to the harsh requirements of the wilderness (and have no desire to return to domestication). Most animals will be  willing  targets  of  this  spell,  but  those  with  a  strong  tie  to  a particular human may prefer domestication.
16. Animal Mastery V - As Animal Mastery I , except caster can control up to five animals.
17. Animal Restoration III - Caster may heal any non-fatal dam -age in any animal of any size or heal fatal damage in an Animal of Medium size or smaller.

  

1. Herb Lore -  Caster can understand the nature, origin, value, and uses of any magical herb. If a plant is not a magical herb, no information can be gained other than that fact.
2. Herb Enhancement II - Allows caster to enhance the efficacy of any one herb (growing or dead) with healing or durational ef -fects. For healing herbs, recovery rolls receive an extra +25 bonus. For herbs with a durational effect, the duration is doubled (i.e., x2). This spell may be employed only once per herb.
3.  Herb  Finding  I -  Allows  caster  to  locate  any  one  specific variety  of  herb  that  is  sought,  regardless  of  physical  obstacles. This spell gives exact direction, distance, and quantity. If multiple patches of the herb are within range, the caster is aware of all of them.
4. Instant Herbal Cures - Allows caster to prepare one dose of any herb so that it will be instantly effective. When the herb is subsequently used, its benefits/dangers will be immediately felt. The herb will keep for 1 day per level of the caster.
5. Herb Mastery II - Caster can double the potency of any one herb (growing or dead). This has the effect of halving the quantity of herb needed for a full dose, i.e. if a normal dose requires one full leaf to be effective, following this spell, only half a leaf would be required. This spell may be employed only once per herb. May not be combined with Herb Enhancement .
6. Herb Finding III - As Herb Finding I , except that the range is 300'.

9. Herb Finding V - As Herb Finding I , except range is 500'.
10. Herb Cleansing - Allows caster to remove any harmful poi -sons, by-products, or side effects from all herbs within range. This includes eliminating any addictive properties.

13. Far Herb Finding I - As Herb Finding I , except range is 1 mile. Location is known within 10'R.

30.  Herb Mastery True - As Herb Mastery II ,  except  that  the potency of 1 herb, growing or dead, can be increased by 100% x lvl/5 of caster (e.g., a 30th Ivl caster could increase potency of any herb by 600%, i.e., 6x, so one normal 'dose' of a herb could be split into six effective portions).
35. Instant Herbal Cures True - As Instant Herbal Cures , except herb will keep until used.
40. Mass Instant Herbal Cures - As Preserved Instant Herbal Cures , except affects up to 1 herb/level.

Note: Weather Prediction is  based  on  current  conditions.  Natural evolution of the weather system produces some uncertainty, which is represented by the 5% chance of error. Magical or divine inter -vention can alter weather patterns beyond those natural uncertainty parameters  and  completely  void  the Weather  Prediction (e.g.,  a 'sunny and clear' prediction is made for the next three days. Later that day, another caster casts a Storm Call in the area. That disturbs local weather patterns and the Weather Prediction must be recast in order to learn what the new weather pattern is likely to produce).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Trap Awareness - Caster has a 75% chance of detecting each individual trap in a 5'R. Caster can concentrate on a 5'R area each round. There must be plants or animals in the area of effect or no information will be gained. Spiders and insects are animals, so many indoor environments will still allow the use of this spell. If a trap is missed, the spell will not find it no matter how many times the caster scans the same area.
2. Nature's Awareness I - Allows caster to monitor animate activity in the area (e.g., the caster will be aware of movements, subtle and  overt).  Caster  cannot  move  while  concentrating.  Caster  does not receive a picture of what is moving, just an awareness of the movement. This will  allow  distinguishing  general  size  and  shape of  a  moving  object.  Someone  staying  still,  but  breathing,  will  be detected, but only a very general idea of size would be determinable.
3.  Pathfinding II - Caster learns the location(s) of any 'path(s)' within 200'. The spell gives the nearest point on the path, but not the path's course. (See Section 10.16 for information on interpretation of 'path'.)
4. Detect Magic - Detects any active spell or active magical item. Caster can concentrate on a different 5'R area each round. (See Sec -tion 10.4 for more about detection spells.)
5. Weather Prediction I - Caster has a 95% chance of correctly predicting time, type, and severity of weather over the next 24 hr period.
6.  Nature's Awareness II - As Nature's Awareness I ,  except that the radius is 200'.
7. Weather Prediction III - As Weather Prediction I , except period is 3 days.
8. Locate Landmark I - For the duration of this spell, the caster will know the direction and distance to any unique natural feature that the caster is familiar with. The feature must be within range or no information is gained.
9. Waiting Awareness I - Allows caster to set up a natural 'alarm system' in the area of effect; any disturbing activity will cause caster to  be  alerted. This  alert  will  wake  the  caster,  if  he  is  in  a  natural sleep.
10. Nature's Awareness III - As Nature's Awareness I , except that radius is 300'.
11. Weather Prediction V - As Weather Prediction I , except period is 5 days.
12.  Memory's  Path -  Caster  can  remember  an  exact  route  that the caster has previously traveled regardless of whether or not the original journey was made with the caster's normal sensory abilities active  (e.g.,  a  12th  level  caster  could  remember  the  course  of  12 hours of a trip even if blindfolded during that time). To be effective, this spell must be cast within one month of the journey.
13. Waiting Awareness II - As Waiting Awareness I , except radius is 100'.
14. Locate Landmark II - As Locate Landmark I , except for range.
15. Nature's Eye I - Allows caster to visualize and sense activity in a known fixed area (100'R).
16. Nature's Awareness V - As Nature Awareness I , except radius is 500'.
17.  Elemental  Communication -  Caster  can  communicate  with any elemental force within range. The elemental force must be able to communicate (i.e., this spell does not confer communication abil -ities upon the force, just translation of those it does have). Elemental forces include all elementals, water spirits, forest spirits, etc.
18. Water Visions - The target of this spell is a small pool of water. The water must be calm (and remain calm for the duration of the spell). The caster may designate a topic and a vision will appear in the pool that relates to the topic. The vision will take 1-50 rounds.
19. Locate Landmark True - As Locate Landmark I ,  except for range.
20. Nature's Eye II - As Nature's Eye I , except the range is 10 miles and caster can monitor an area of 500'R.
25.  Weather  Prediction True - As Weather Prediction  I ,  except period is 1 day/level.
30. Nature's Eye III - As Nature's Eye I , except range is 100 miles and caster can monitor an area of 500'R.
35.  Nature's Awareness True - As Nature's Awareness I ,  except radius is 100'/level.
40.  Commune with Nature -  Caster  is  made  aware  of  the  eco -logical  health  of  the  area  and  anything  that  is  causing  significant ecological impact on the area (e.g., the water from the magic spring makes everything here grow fast, poison is leaching out from the pile of mine tailings, or the unicorns prevent disease from spreading through the wildlife).
50. Druidic Eye - Allows caster to monitor an area of 100'R that the caster has both been to and become acquainted with (i.e., spent at least 1 day meditating in or 30 days living in).

Note : Hues and Shadow are obviously incompatible.

Illusions (which include the Façade spells)  are  one of the more complex  and  subtle  types  of  magic  and  they  are  explained  at length in Section 10.10.

  

1. Study Form - Caster studies and memorizes the form of one type of animal or plant for use with spells later on this list. The caster can only have as many forms of each kingdom studied as he has ranks in this list. Thus, a Druid with 8 ranks in Nature's Protection may have studied 8 types of animal and 8 types of plant. Caster may choose to forget a studied form at any time to make room for replacements.
2. Resist Elements - Protects caster from natural heat up to 176°F (80°C) and natural cold down to 14°F (-10°C), experiencing either as a 68°F (20°C) environment. For temperatures beyond the protect -ed ranges, treat the caster as being in an environment of 20°C mod -ified by one degree per degree beyond the protection limit (e.g., if the temperature were 180°F, the caster would experience it as 72°F). Against cold/ice or heat/fire attacks, the caster gains +20 to DB and RRs. Duration is 1 hour per level if the caster does not move, but if the caster moves, then duration becomes Concentration.
3. Hues - Allows caster to take on the physical coloration of any 1 organic object. The caster must be in contact with the object when the spell is cast. In many situations, this will give a +10 to +50 bonus (GM's discretion) to Stalking attempts.
4. Plant Façade - Allows caster to appear as any one type of plant that he has studied. This is purely a visual illusion: caster will still sound, smell, and feel the same, and the caster undergoes no phys -ical change.
5. Silent Moves - Caster can move silently, so long as he does not create a sound originating more than 1' from his body. This typically provides a +10 to +50 bonus (GM's discretion) to Stalking maneu -vers when moving.
6.  Underwater  Breathing -  Caster  can  breathe  normally  under water. Water may be salt or fresh, but no other liquid is breathable by means of this spell.
7. Animal Façade - Allows caster  to  appear  as  any  one  type  of animal that he has studied. This is purely a visual illusion: caster will still sound, smell, and feel the same, and the caster undergoes no physical change.
8. Shadow - Caster and objects on his person appear to be a shadow and are almost invisible in dark areas (in many situations this could be handled with a Stalking bonus between +25 and +75).
9. Organic Defense I * - Any single attack made against the caster this  round suffers a -50 modifier. The weapon or object defended against must be from an organic source (e.g., an animal) or at least a partially organic weapon (e.g., an arrow) and the caster must be able to see the attack.
10. Plant Form I - Allows caster to take the form of any one plant he has studied. The caster will look and feel like the plant. The cast -er's size can change by up to one size increment. Caster does not gain the physical abilities of the plant other than Size category.
11. Protection From Elements - As Resist Elements , except it pro -tects caster from any natural heat or natural cold (treat as if caster were in 68°F [20°C] environment), and DB/RR bonus is +40.
12. Animal Thoughts I - For the duration of this spell, the caster's mental patterns will appear to be those of any animal he has studied. The caster cannot move while this spell is active.
13. Organic Defense II * - As Organic Defense I , except the pen -alty is -100.
14. Animal Form I - Allows  caster  to  take  the  form  of  any  one animal he has studied. The caster will look and feel like the animal. The caster's size can be varied up to one size increment. Caster does not gain the physical abilities of the animal, other than Size category.
15. Animal Thoughts II - As Animal Thoughts I , except caster can move (though he must still maintain concentration).
16. Plant Form II - As Plant Form I , except caster may also assume the scent and physical abilities of the plant.
17. Animal Form II - As Animal Form I ,  except caster may also assume the movement abilities of the animal.
18. Organic Defense III * - As Organic Defense I ,  except attack automatically misses.
19. Animal Form III - As Animal Form II , except caster also gains the  physical  attacks  of  the  animal.  Caster  can  vary  his  size  up  to two Size increments. Caster gains normal OB of the animal with its natural attacks, gaining the instincts to use them properly.
20. Plant Form True - As Plant Form II , except caster can change his form to any other plant he has studied at any time during the du -ration of the spell and he can vary his size by up to 2 size increments.
25. Animal Form True - As Animal Form III ,  except  caster  can change  his  form  to  any  other  animal  he  has  studied  at  any  time during the duration of the spell and caster has all physical abilities of the animal.
30. Nature's Form True - As Plant Form Tru e and Animal Form True operating at the same time.
35. Animal Thoughts True - As Animal Thoughts II , except caster does not need to concentrate, and duration is 1 minute per level.
40. Master of Natural Forms - As Nature's Form True, except for duration.
50. Organic Defense True * - As Organic Defense III , except one attack may be defended against each round the spell is in effect.

See Section 10.2 regarding curses.

  

1. Nature's Ire I * - The caster's next attack gains a +5 to its OB. If the caster is attacking in animal form, this bonus is doubled.
2.  Nature's Curse -  Target  will  find  that  animals,  both  wild  and  do -mestic have become wary of him. All maneuvers dealing with handling, influencing, or working with animals suffer a penalty of -25.
3. Entangling Vegetation I - Plants around the target become highly animated and attempt to take hold of the target. Treat as a size Small Grapple attack with an OB equal to the caster's skill in this list. This spell requires the presence of suitable plants (grasses, flowers, or larger plants). If a Grapple % result occurs, the plants will continue to hold the target until it is freed. For attempts to break free, treat the plants' Grap -pling skill as equal to the original OB and their Strength bonus as +0.
4. Shock Bolt I - A bolt of intense, charged light is shot from the palm of the caster; results are determined on the Lightning Bolt attack table, as a Miniscule attack.
5. Nature's Ire II * - As Nature's Ire I , except bonus is +10.
6. Wall of Fire - Creates an opaque wall of fire (up to 10'x10'x6"). Any -one passing through it  takes  an A  Heat  critical  (no  RR).  See  Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

  

1. Holy Cancellation Evil - When the caster is a target of a  spell  from  an  Evil  spell  list,  the  'incoming'  spell  must first make an RR before the caster makes an RR. If the 'in -coming' spell passes the RR, it may target the caster of this spell normally; otherwise the incoming spell has no effect on this target. Being a 'willing target' does not eliminate this effect, but the caster's own spells do not need to make an RR. Note that the caster is considered to be a target of any spell which includes him in its area of effect or would 'detect' him.
2. Holy Cancellation Channeling - As Holy Cancellation Evil , except affects spells from the realm of Channeling.
3. Holy Cancellation Essence - As Holy Cancellation Evil , except affects spells from the realm of Essence.
4. Holy Cancellation Mentalism - As Holy Cancellation Evil , except affects spells from the realm of Mentalism.
5. Dispel Evil I - Any active spell from an Evil spell list that is on the target must make an RR. If the spell fails its RR, it is dispelled.
6. Neutralize Curse I - [RR Mod.: -20] Nullifies a curse for the duration of this spell. The curse is not dispelled and takes effect after the duration of this spell.
7. Dispel Channeling I - As Dispel Evil I ,  except affects spells from the realm of Channeling.
8. Dispel Essence I - As Dispel Evil I , except affects spells from the realm of Essence.
9.  Dispel  Mentalism I - As Dispel Evil I,  except  affects spells from the realm of Mentalism.
10. Curse Tales - Caster can determine nature and origin of any one curse, including the name of the one who be -queathed it.
11. Dispel Evil Sphere I - Any active Evil spell that is (at least partly) within the radius of effect must make an RR (use the spell's level for the RR). If the spell fails its RR, it is dispelled.
12. Find Curser I - Caster learns the current location of the caster of a given curse, so long as the caster is within range. Location is direction plus distance. The curse must have been previously analyzed with Curse Tales .
13. Neutralize Curse II - [RR Mod.: -20] As Neutralize Curse I , except curse is nullified for one hour per level.
14. Dispel Channeling Sphere I - As Dispel Evil Sphere I , except affects spells from the realm of Channeling.
15.  Dispel  Essence  Sphere  I - As Dispel  Evil  Sphere  I , except affects spells from the realm of Essence.
16. Dispel Mentalism Sphere I - As Dispel Evil Sphere I , except affects spells from the realm of Mentalism.
17. Find Curser II - As Find Curser I , except range is 10 miles per level.
18. Spellproof - [RR Mod: -20] As Holy Cancellation Evil , except affects all spells, 'incoming' spells make their RR at -20, and duration is 10 minutes per level.
19. Dispel Evil Sphere V - As Dispel Evil Sphere I , except radius is 50'.
20. Uncurse - Dispels a curse if the curse fails an RR. The curse's level is the level of the caster of the curse. If the curse is not dispelled, the caster cannot try again until he has gone up another level of experience.
25. Dispel Channeling Sphere V - As Dispel Channeling Sphere I , except radius is 50'.
30. Uncurse True - [RR Mod.: -50] As Uncurse ,  except curse makes its RR with a -50 penalty.
35. Dispel Essence Sphere V - As Dispel Essence Sphere I , except radius is 50'.
40.  Dispel  Mentalism  Sphere V - As Dispel  Mentalism Sphere I , except radius is 50'.
50. Magic Bane - As Dispel Evil Sphere V , except affects all spells and duration is one minute per level. Any given spell need only resist this spell once, but any spell coming into the area of effect while this spell is active must make its RR or be dispelled. Sphere moves with the caster.

1. Holy Attack I * - Adds +5 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
2. Righteous Blow I - After casting this spell, the caster's next melee or missile attack will, if made against a foe who receives a critical reduction due to size or other factors, have the critical reduction reduced by one. For example, a Medium combatant at -tacking a Large foe would normally have a C critical done against that foe reduced to an A critical. If that Medium combatant ben -efited from this spell, that critical would only be reduced to a B.
3. Holy Strength I - Caster gains a +5 to his Strength stat bonus.
4. Holy Attack II * - Adds +10 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
5. Righteous Blow II - As Righteous Blow I , except two steps of critical reduction are negated.
6.  Blessed Weapon - Weapon becomes indestructable for spell duration. This includes not only normal breakage, but also magical effects that would break or otherwise damage the weapon. It is still possible to disarm the wielder of the weapon. Once the weapon has spent three consecutive rounds outside the caster's possession, it can be broken normally.
7. Holy Attack III * - Adds +15 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
8. Righteous Blow III - As Righteous Blow I , except three steps of critical reduction are negated.
9. Holy Aura I - A bright, shimmering aura surrounds the caster. All creatures 'of darkness' who are in the area of effect must make an RR each round or receive an A severity Holy critical.
10. Holy Attack IV * - Adds +20 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
11. Righteous Blow IV - As Righteous Blow I , except four steps of critical reduction are negated.
12.  Holy  Strength  II -  Caster  gains  a  +10  to  his  Strength  stat bonus.
13. Holy Attack V * - Adds +25 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
14. Faithful Arms - Caster will not fumble. Caster cannot be disarmed nor his weapon(s) broken while the spell lasts.
15. Holy Aura II - A bright, shimmering aura surrounds the cast -er. All creatures 'of darkness' who are in the area of effect must make an RR each round or receive a B severity Holy critical.
16. Holy Attack VI * - Adds +30 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
17. Holy Strength III - Caster gains a +15 to his Strength stat bonus.
18. Holy Throw * - Caster immediately hurls a (melee) weapon, which attacks using his normal throwing OB with the weapon or his  melee  OB  with  the  weapon,  whichever  is  higher. This  spell allows this attack to use the ranges for a short bow.
19. Holy Attack VII * - Adds +35 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
20. Holy Aura III - A bright, shimmering aura surrounds the cast -er. All creatures 'of darkness' who are in the area of effect must make an RR each round or receive a C severity Holy critical.
25. Holy Attack VIII * - Adds +40 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
30. Holy Aura IV - A bright, shimmering aura surrounds the cast -er. All creatures 'of darkness' who are in the area of effect must make an RR each round or receive a D severity Holy critical.
35. Holy Attack X * - Adds +50 to the caster's melee or missile OB for the current round.
40. Holy Aura True - A bright, shimmering aura surrounds the caster. All  creatures  'of  darkness'  who  are  in  the  area  of  effect must make an RR each round or receive an E severity Holy critical.
50. Martyrdom - Caster exposes all within the area of effect to the raw power of his deity. This has an effect equal to a Fire Ball attack with an OB equal to twice the caster's level (i.e., a 50th lev -el caster results in a +100 OB), with concussion damage doubled, Fire criticals replaced with Holy criticals, and all criticals being treated as Slaying III .  The caster acts as the center-point for the blast and is not immune to any of the damage. For the caster, no objects, spells, etc. will protect him from the blast.

See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells (various Relief,  Healing ,  and Healing True spells).

Note : None of the 'Aura' spells ( Aura, True Aura, Mass Aura, and Alkar ) are cumulative with each other or Blur . The Gamemaster may wish to allow the bonus from these spells to apply to Leader -ship as well as defense.

When under the effects of an Unpain spell, there are no penalties for hits lost. Full effects of the lost hits occur when the spell du -ration  ends.  However,  if  the  hits  are  healed  before  the  duration ends, there is no effect. So, a character could be reduced to -38 hits while sustained by Unpain ,  but restored to 2 hits before the duration of the spell ended. He would never pass out. Likewise, if Unpain allows fighting beyond lethal hit loss, this has no effect until the spell expires.

The GM should be careful and clear when defining 'alignment'. Depending on the state of theology in the game world, this might mean that one needs to worship the caster's deity, or it might mere -ly  require  that  a  deity  of  the  same  mythos  be  followed  (e.g.,  in a world using Greek, Norse, Indian, Chinese, and Celtic gods, a devotee of Zeus might be considered of the same 'alignment' as a priest of Poseidon).

  

1.  Protection Prayer I - Everyone in the area of effect who is aligned with the caster (see above) subtracts 5 from all elemental attacks against them. They may also add 5 to all RRs versus spells. These bonuses are not conferred to the caster.
2. Aura - Causes a bright aura about the caster, providing a more powerful appearance and subtracting 10 from all attacks on the caster.
3.  Shield of Faith * - Creates a golden full shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of the caster's faith. If the caster has a free arm, it functions in all ways as a physical shield, but it does not count  for  encumbrance,  and  lasts  for  1  minute  per  level.  If  the caster  does  not  have  a  free  arm,  it  moves  of  its  own  accord  to defend the caster, providing +25 DB against up to 3 frontal attacks per round, but cannot benefit from Shield skill and cannot be com -

bined with any other shield, and the duration is only 1 round per level. In either case, it is unbreakable.

4.  Guardianship * - Caster may employ the Protecting Others rules (see RMCL Section 9.7) to defend two other individuals at the  same  time  with  only  the  normal  penalty  for  protecting  one individual.
5. Unpain I * - Caster is able to sustain an additional 25% of his total concussion hits (round off fractional hits) before passing out. Hits are still taken and remain when the spell lapses.
6. Protection Prayer II - As Protection Prayer I , except bonuses are 10.
7.  Deflections I * - Caster can deflect any one missile that the caster can see and which passes within the 100' range of this spell; this causes 50 to be subtracted from the missile's attack.
8. True Aura - As Aura , except it produces an extremely powerful appearance and subtracts 15 from all attacks.
9. Bladeturn I * - As Deflections I , except its effect is against 1 melee attack.
10. Unpain II * - As Unpain I , except an additional 50% of hits can be sustained.
11. Protection Prayer III - As Protection Prayer I ,  except bo -nuses are 15.
12. Deflections II * - As Deflections I , except 2 missiles may be affected.
13. Aim Untrue I * - As Deflections I , except missile automati -cally misses.
14. Bladeturn II * - As Bladeturn I , except 2 melee attacks may be affected.
15. Unpain III * - As Unpain I , except an additional 75% of hits can be sustained.
16. Protection Prayer IV - As Protection Prayer I ,  except bo -nuses are 20.
17. Deflections III * - As Deflections I , except 3 missiles may be affected.
18. Aim Untrue II * - As Aim Untrue I ,  except 2 missiles may be affected.
19. Bladeturn III * - As Bladeturn I , except 3 melee attacks may be affected.
20. Unpain IV * - As Unpain I , except an additional 100% of hits can be sustained.
25. Protection Prayer V - As Protection Prayer I , except bonuses are 25.
30. Mass Deflections * - As Deflections I , except as many mis -siles as the caster's level may be affected.
35. Mass Bladeturn * - As Bladeturn I ,  except as many melee attacks as the caster's level may be affected.
40.  Armor  of  Faith  * -  Creates  a  golden  suit  of  plate  armor around the caster. This armor does not interfere with spell-casting, but otherwise acts as a normal suit of armor with Armor Type 10 including arm and leg armor and helmet.
50.  Protection  Prayer  True - As Protection  Prayer  V ,  except radius of effect is 100' and duration is 10 minutes per level.

Note : Smite spell criticals do not get adjusted by size.

An 'enemy' for purposes of this list is not just someone the caster is fighting against at the moment. It must be someone (or something) who bears a conscious and lasting hostility to the caster's religion.

2. Reveal Enemies - Detects the total number of 'enemies' (giving approximate direction and distance). This spell also reveals the most heavily represented type of enemy (by to -tal levels). Caster can concentrate on a different 50'R each round.
3. Smite Undead I * - Caster's next melee attack (within one minute of casting this spell) which scores a critical on an undead will do an additional A Holy critical.
4. Smite Demon I * - Caster's next melee attack (within one minute of casting this spell) which scores a critical on a demon will do an additional A Holy critical.
5. Resist Undead I - The caster gains a +10 bonus to his RRs against Life Drain by the undead.
6. Enemy Speech - For the duration of this spell, the caster can read and speak one 'enemy' language with skill rank 8.

8. Smite Demon II * - As Smite Demon I , except the addi -tional Holy critical is severity B.
9. Smite Enemy I * - Caster's next melee attack (within one minute of casting this spell) which scores a critical on an 'enemy' will do an additional A Holy critical.

'Gen -eral' means that the caster could learn that the undead were mainly skeletons, but not which type(s) of skeletons.
16. Smite Undead IV * - As Smite Undead I ,  except the additional Holy critical is severity D.
17.  Smite  Demon IV * - As Smite  Demon I ,  except  the additional Holy critical is severity D.

Note : Voice and Words spells will only work on targets who are not actively hostile to the caster.

Voice and Words spells  increase  favorable  reactions. This effect  lasts  1  hour  per  level  of  the  caster  after  the  caster stops speaking. After this duration, the target's natural ten -dencies and reactions will take over. Note that most targets will continue to believe the caster even after the spell has lapsed.

Any target who resists a Voice or Words spell by more than 50 will realize that the caster was using magical influence.

Note : Hues and Shadow are  obviously  incompatible,  but  either might be combined with Shade .

Illusions (which include the Façade spells) are one of the more com -plex and subtle types of magic and they are explained at length in Section 10.10.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Hues - Allows caster to take on the physical coloration of any 1 organic object. The caster must be in contact with the object when the spell is cast. In many situations, this will give a +10 to +50 bonus (GM's discretion) to Stalking attempts.
2.  Shade -  All  shadows  and  darkness  within  the  area  of  effect deepen, giving all Perception maneuvers involving seeing anything hidden/hiding in the area a penalty of -20. Area is not mobile.
3. Mask Scent - Caster's odor becomes greatly reduced, providing a -50 penalty for the caster to be detected or tracked using the sense of smell.
4. Silent Moves - Caster can move silently, so long as he does not create a sound originating more than 1' from his body. This typically provides a +10 to +50 bonus (GM's discretion) to Stalking maneu -vers.
5.  Blending - Caster blends into surrounding terrain, providing a +75 bonus to Stalking attempts. Caster may not move (appreciably) without  destroying  this  effect.  This  bonus  is  not  cumulative  with Hues or Shadow .
6. Shadow - Caster and objects on his person appear to be a shadow and are almost invisible in dark areas (e.g., in many situations this could be handled with a Stalking bonus between +25 and +75).
7. Study Form - Caster studies and memorizes the form of one type of animal or plant for use with spells later on this list. The caster can only have as many forms of each kingdom studied as he has ranks in this list. Thus, a Ranger with 8 ranks in Nature's Guises may have studied 8 types of animal and 8 types of plant. Caster may choose to forget a studied form at any time to make room for replacements.

8. Plant Façade - Allows caster to appear as any one type of plant that he has studied. This is purely a visual illusion: caster will still sound, smell, and feel the same, and the caster undergoes no phys -ical change.

9. Animal Thoughts I - For the duration of this spell, the caster's mental patterns will appear to be those of any animal he has studied. The caster cannot move while this spell is active.

10. Study Form True - As Study Form , except a particular animal or plant form may be studied. For example, the woodsman's dog (as opposed to just a dog) may be studied. The caster may only have as many of these particular forms studied as he has ranks in this list. These are in addition to the general forms learned by Study Form.

11. Animal Façade - Allows caster to appear as any one type of animal that he has studied. This is purely a visual illusion: caster will still sound, smell, and feel the same, and the caster undergoes no physical change.

12.  Terrible  Form  * -  Caster  momentarily  takes  on  a  fearsome appearance that requires all within a 20' radius to resist versus Fear (attack level is that of the caster) or flee for 1 round per 5 fail. Targets must be able to see the caster in order to be affected.

13. Animal Thoughts II - As Animal Thoughts I , except caster can move (though he must still maintain concentration).

14. Friendly Form - Caster appears to be friendly and pleasant so long as he does not make any overtly hostile action. This adds +20 to his social interactions with all living things.

15. Plant Form I - Allows caster to take the form of any one plant he has studied. The caster will look and feel like the plant. The cast -er's size can change by up to one size increment. Caster does not gain the physical abilities of the plant other than Size category.

16. Mass Blending - As Blending , except affects 1 target/level.

17. Animal Form I - Allows caster to take the  form  of  any  one animal he has studied. The caster will look and feel like the animal. The caster's size can be varied up to one size increment. Caster does not gain the physical abilities of the animal, other than Size category.

18. Nightmare Form - As Terrible Form , except dreadful appear -ance  lasts  for  1  round  per  level,  during  which  any  person  in  the radius of effect must make an RR against Fear each round (with a +10 bonus for each RR after the first) or flee for 1 round per 5 fail. Targets must be able to see the caster in order to be affected. Those who flee in terror will afterwards not be able to recollect clearly what the caster looked like.

19. Plant Form II - As Plant Form I , except caster may also assume the scent and physical abilities of the plant.

20. Animal Form II - As Animal Form I ,  except caster may also assume the movement abilities of the animal.

25. Animal Form III - As Animal Form II , except caster also gains the  physical  attacks  of  the  animal.  Caster  can  vary  his  size  up  to two Size increments. Caster gains normal OB of the animal with its natural attacks, gaining the instincts to use them properly.

30. Plant Form True - As Plant Form II , except caster can change his form to any other plant he has studied at any time during the du -ration of the spell and he can vary his size by up to 2 size increments.

35. Animal Thoughts True - As Animal Thoughts II , except caster does not need to concentrate, and duration is 1 minute per level.

40. Animal Form True - As Animal Form III ,  except  caster  can change  his  form  to  any  other  animal  he  has  studied  at  any  time during the duration of the spell and caster has all physical abilities of the animal.

50. Nature's Form True - As Plant Form True and Animal Form True operating at the same time.

<!-- image -->

  

1. Pathlore - Caster learns the origin and nearest 'destination' of any path within the area of effect.
2. Orient Self - Caster knows which way is north, which way is up, and his distance above or below the ground's surface.
3. Tracking II - Caster gets a +50 bonus to all Tracking maneu -vers.
4. Path Tale - Caster acquires a visual image of any user(s) of a given path, up to 1 hour in the past per level of the caster.
5. Far Pathfinding I - Caster learns the location(s) of any path(s) within 1 mile. This spell reveals the nearest point of each path, but not the path's course.
6. Tracks Lore - Caster learns the origin of one set of tracks, and acquires a visual image of the one who left them. Caster will gain a +25 bonus when tracking this particular being or animal.
7. Sense Ambush I - Caster is aware of any being within the area of  effect  that  has  hostile  intentions  towards  him  (i.e.,  he  knows their number and locations). The hostility must be directed specif -ically at the caster (or the group he is in) or the spell reveals noth -ing. The being's hostility must be active (i.e., driving the being to perform aggressive actions), not passive (i.e., hate exists, but no action is planned).
8. Passing Lore - Caster acquires visual and aural (sound) images of any being or animal that has passed within a 50'R of a specific object. The being or animal can have passed up to 1 hour per level earlier. If more than one being or animal has passed, the caster will see them one image at a time, one image per round (starting with the oldest image).
9. Far Pathfinding V - As Far Pathfinding I ,  except range is 5 miles.
10. Nature's Tongues - Allows caster to understand and 'speak' the language of any one animal or plant species.
11. Tracks Analysis - Caster acquires a visual image of all beings or animals who left tracks in the area. This provides a +50 bonus when later tracking any of these beings or animals. If more than one being or animal has left tracks, the caster will see them one image  at  a  time,  one  image  per  round  (starting  with  the  oldest image).
12. Stonespeech - Caster can communicate with any one stone if it possesses any mental qualities (e.g., caster could speak to a holy stone which possesses some sort of intelligence).
13. Far Pathfinding XX - As Far Pathfinding I , except range is 20 miles.
14. Sense Ambush II - As Sense Ambush I , except area of effect is 100'R.
15. Monster Tongues - Allows caster to understand and 'speak' the  language  of  any  one  species  of  'natural'  monster.  This  ex -cludes the undead, artificial creations (e.g., constructs), and enti -ties from another plane (e.g., demons).
16. Tracking III - Caster gets a +75 bonus to all Tracking ma -neuvers.
17. Sense Ambush III - As Sense Ambush I , except area of effect is 150'R.
18. Underwater Tracking - Caster can track individuals through an underwater environment without penalty.
19. Paths True - As Far Pathfinding I , except range is 1 mile per level and exact routes within the range are ascertained.
20.  Sense Ambush True - As Sense Ambush I ,  except  area  of effect is 10'R/lvl.
25.  Know Path - Allows caster to ascertain the proper path to what he seeks (includes the course along that path). For example, he could know the quickest way to the city or the safest way to the city, depending on his goals.
30. Tracking True - Negates any Hide Tracks spell (except for Hide Tracks True) and provides a +100 Tracking bonus.
35. Aerial Tracking - Caster can track individuals through the air (i.e., track a flying being, object) without penalty.
40. Life Path Lore - Caster learns of one being: where it origi -nated (was born/created), where it began its current journey, and where it is currently bound, both its next destination and ultimate destination, if these are not the same. This will detect the largest, most important journey that the target is on. For example, if cast on two individuals going out to fetch water from the local well, that is what the spell would reveal if cast on the innkeeper's daughter who is not planning on going anywhere in particular other than back to the inn with the water, but if the other person was a pilgrim traveling to a holy city, just getting some water at a stopover point, then that pilgrimage would be the journey revealed.
50. Tracks Ahead - Allows caster to know entire course of the tracks in the area of effect (i.e., exactly where and how they go). This will not negate Hide Tracks True .

1. Survival I - Caster receives a +25 bonus to all Survival ma -neuvers.
2.  Fire  Starting - Allows caster to  set  a  fire  of  1'R;  fire  will then last as long as there is fuel. A target in the 1'R will take an A Heat critical. Caster may only target a specific location, not an individual, with this spell.
3. Wound Tending - Caster gains a +20 bonus to all Medicine or Herbalism maneuvers.
4. Eye for Traps - Caster gains a +50 bonus to any roll to notice a trap.
5. Survival II - As Survival I , except the bonus is +50.
6. Water Purification - Allows caster to purify a number of gallons of water equal to the caster's level.
7.  Common Nature I - Any skill similarity penalty for using Survival in a different biome or any animal skill for a different animal is reduced by -25. This spell may be combined with Survival I or II .
8. Lesser Trap - This spell creates a minor, normal trap (con -structed magically). The trap can deliver up to a B critical strike (must be either a Slash, Krush or a Puncture; specified by the caster at time of casting) to any one target. The size of the trap may vary from 1'R to 10'R. The time to construct this trap is 1 round per 1'R.
9.  Traceless  Encampment -  All  traces  of  an  encampment vanish.  No  trace  is  left  of  the  fire  pit,  tracks  in  the  area  of  the encampment are erased, etc. One casting covers the traces of 10 people or animals; additional castings can be used to cover larger camps. This spell does not prevent new traces from being created if the group is still present, it only erases traces that have already accumulated.
10. Nature's Awareness I - Allows caster to monitor animate activity in the area (e.g., the caster will be aware of movements, subtle and overt). Caster cannot move while concentrating. Caster does not receive a picture of what is moving, just an awareness

of the movement. This will allow distinguishing general size and shape of a moving object. Someone staying still, but breathing, will  be  detected,  but  only  a  very  general  idea  of  size  would  be determinable.

Locate Natural Object - Caster may locate the nearest nat -ural object of a specified type, e.g. a specified type of animal or plant, a natural spring, a cave, etc. The object can be a specific item  if  the  caster  is  personally  familiar  with  that  item  (e.g.  the ranger can find his own horse, or the nearest horse, but not a spe -cific horse that has only been described to him). Caster continues to sense the direction and distance for the duration.

12.  Waiting Awareness  I - Allows  caster  to  set  up  a  natural 'alarm system' in the area of effect; any disturbing activity will cause caster to be alerted. This alert will wake the caster, if he is in a natural sleep.

13. Common Nature II - As Common Nature I , except penalties are reduced by -50.

14. Major Trap - As Lesser Trap , except trap can deliver an E critical hit.

15. Concealed Encampment - As Traceless Encampment ,  ex -cept that it will actively hide an encampment still in use. Sleeping areas are shrouded by plants or become recessed into the ground, any fire  casts  light  only  visible  in  a  10'R  area  and  produces  no smoke, no tracks are left by those staying in the encampment, etc. Hides 1 person/animal per caster level. Any Awareness maneuver to locate the camp suffers a -100 penalty.

16. Weather Prediction - Caster has a 95% chance of predicting weather over a 30-day period.

17. Create Spring - Creates a natural spring producing enough water  to  supply  1  person/animal  per  caster  level.  The  spring  is created in the most appropriate location within 500' (must be in a natural setting at ground level), and the caster immediately knows its  location.  If  in  a  location  which  would  not  normally  support a spring (e.g. in the desert), the spring will last 10 min/lvl. In a suitable location, it may last days or become permanent.
18. Common Nature True - As Common Nature I , except pen -alties are reduced to zero.
19. Locate Natural Object True - As Locate Natural Object , except the range is 10 miles.
20.  Nature's Awareness V - As Nature's Awareness I ,  except detecting activity up to 500' away.
25. Waiting Awareness II - As Waiting Awareness I, except over a 100' radius.
30. Ambush Awareness - Caster becomes aware of the presence, general location, general type, and number of any actively hostile beings in the area of effect. These beings do not have to be spe -cifically hostile to the caster, but may simply be generally hostile.
35. Adaptation - Caster's body adapts to survive in any natural environment. This  can  involve  submersion  in  freezing  water  at depths with crushing pressure, traversing molten lava, or enduring exposure to a raging sandstorm. This does not cover any form of deliberate attack (even while comfortable naked in a blizzard, the caster will still suffer normal damage from a Cold Ball). The GM must determine what conditions qualify as 'natural.'
40. Nature's Awareness True - As Nature's Awareness I , except detecting activity up to 100' per level away from the caster.
50. Survivor - Caster can use one lower level spell on this list each round.

1. Curse Detection - Detects a curse on an item or person.

2. Nightvision Curse - Target can see at night as if it were day, but he can only see in the day as if it were the darkest night.

3. Sky Curse - Target will never voluntarily fly by any means, nor climb any greater height than 100'.

4. Ulcer Curse - Target can only eat bread or dairy products. Any -thing else will aggravate his ulcer (unless he makes a physical RR vs 4th level) and he will be incapacitated for 1-10 hours.

5. Curse of Dake - Target cannot move faster than a walking pace on his own (he may be carried or ride at a faster pace).

6. Green Tongue - Target can only eat green leaves. Eating other food incapacitates him (if he fails a physical RR vs 6 th level) for 1-10 hours.

7. Sea Curse - Target will never voluntarily swim, enter any water (even a bath), or get into a boat.

8. Curse of Furd - All of target's fumble numbers (before any reduction due to skill) when attacking are doubled (e.g., a fumble number of 4 becomes 8). When rolling absolute maneuvers, any result  of  50  or  less  is  absolute  failure. When  rolling  percentage maneuvers, an 'F' result always results in some additional prob -lem arising.

9. Excommunication - Target loses all Power Points if target is a Channeling spell user. He cannot cast any spells from the Channel -ing realm, even by use of magic items, including Runes. A hybrid user of Channeling will only lose half of his Power Points, but can -not cast his Base lists as well as those which are pure Channeling. These PP cannot be regained until the duration of the spell ends or the curse is removed.

10. Learning of Mins - Target can only speak and write in his native language.

11. Curse of Shar Bu - Target is sterile and impotent.

12. Power Leech - Target loses 1 Power Point every 10 minutes. Power Points are recovered in a normal fashion, but begin to leak away as soon as they are regained.

13. Beauty of Arraer - Target's appearance becomes extremely attractive. If anyone sees the uncovered face of the target or gets within 3' (and is of an appropriate sexual orientation and fails an RR), that person will attempt to possess and carry off the target (fighting if necessary). Certain persons will get modifications to their RRs (positive or negative) based on outlook (a hedonist from a tribe that routinely kidnaps brides would be at a large penalty, an ascetic who had taken an oath of celibacy would have a bonus).

14. Clotting Curse - Target's blood will coagulate and create a blood clot around the area of any cut wound (bleeding at least one hit per round). The clot will cut off circulation to the area fed by the given vessel and target will lose the affected body section after 2-20 minutes due to system damage (e.g., a thigh wound might ultimately  mean loss  of  leg;  a  neck  wound  would  be  fatal). An Extremely Hard (-30)  Medicine  maneuver,  taking  1d10  rounds, will  prevent  loss  of  the  body  part,  as  will  a Joining spell  from Blood Law, Blood Mastery, or Blood Ways.

15. Ugliness of Orn - Target's appearance becomes hideous and horrifying.  If  a  person  sees  the  uncovered  face  of  the  target  or gets within 3' of the target, he must make an RR. If he fails by more than 50, he attacks the target. If he fails by 50 or less, he will make every effort short of endangering his own safety to get away from the target. Even if he makes his RR, the viewer will experience extreme distaste for the target. Friends and family will gain bonuses to their RRs, but even they will regard the target with pity and disgust.

16. Curse of Oli - Target will lie 50% of the time, regardless of the topic.

17. Curse of Blarm - Any time that the target rolls doubles (e.g., a  natural  roll  of  44),  the  equipment  he  is  using  must  check  for breakage.

18. Curse of Penth - Target may only speak the truth.

19. Rewounding - Once per day (at a random time), the target will experience the pain from an old wound. For new characters, treat this as an A Krush critical strike (rerolling a lethal result) 50% of  the  time  and  d10  concussion  hits  the  other  50%  of  the  time. Alternatively, the GM can re-open a specific old wound.

20. Running Curse - Target will move at fastest possible pace until he collapses of exhaustion (-100 total penalties). He may be restrained, but whenever freed, or he rests enough to recover from penalties to below -50 he will begin to run again.

25. Friendslayer - Every time the target is in a combat situation near friends who are within 10', there is a 10% chance each round (non-cumulative) that he will attack one of his friends (randomly determine  which  one  if  there  are  multiple  possible  targets)  and attempt to kill that friend. For these purposes, a 'friend' includes any companion, ally, or associate.

30. Excommunication True - As Excommunication , except effect is permanent until removed.

35. Curse of Larfi - Target becomes unable to tolerate magical herbs or oral medicines, vomiting them up without benefit. Heal -ing times for all injuries are doubled.

40. Curse of Refusal - Target can never be a willing target of any spell cast by another.

50. Dark Thoughts - Target may not attack any 'evil' creature. The target will obey the commands of any evil being who is 10 or more levels higher than himself, but can command (+30 to Influ -ence and +60 Leadership) any 'Evil' creature whose level is at least 10 below the target's level. See Section 10.8 for definition of 'Evil'.

Note :  See  section  10.8  for  guidelines  for  handling  'good'  and 'evil'.

Absolution does not kill the body, so Dark Absolution leaves  a living, but soulless body.

  

1. Detect Evil Power - Detects any active spell or active magical item from an Evil source, or any entity capable of casting Evil spells; caster can concentrate on a different 5'R area each round. (See Section 10.4 for more about detection spells.)
2. Dark Stunning - [RR Mod.: -10] Caster points his arm (elbow locked and fist clenched) at the target and channels raw power. The target is stunned (-50).
3. Channels I * - When this spell is cast, the 1st level spell that the caster begins to cast (or prepare) the next round will be 'chan -neled' to another spell user of the Channeling realm. The 'chan -neled' spell is transmitted to the other spell user when it would normally take effect, and must be used by the receiving spell user immediately or delayed as described in Section 4.8 (treating the receiving spell user as the caster of the spell). All normal restric -tions on the transmitted spell apply. The caster of the Channels spell must be able to see the receiver or know exactly where the receiver is (direction and distance or specific place). The receiver must know exactly when the spell is coming (but need not know what the spell sent is). For example, if a Cleric was at a certain altar  at  a  certain  time  (midnight  of  full  moon)  ready  to  receive a  spell;  then  another  spell  user  (or  deity)  who  knew  this  could use Channels I to send a spell to that Cleric. Because the spell is passed through the aura of the receiving character, the spell is cast at the level of the receiving character (including any level-based parameters).
4.  Repel  Holy  I -  Causes  a  'holy'  being  or  a  Channeler  of  a 'good' power to be unable to approach closer than 100'  to  the caster and to retreat, if possible, to maintain that distance. If the target fails its RR by more than 30, it must flee (if of this plane) or be banished back to its home plane of existance (in which case

duration is 'permanent'). This spell will affect entities of 'Type I' or of up to 5th level for beings without a 'Type'.

5.  Dark  Sleep -  [RR  Mod.:  -10]  Caster  points  his  arm  (elbow locked and fist clenched) at the target and channels raw power. The target falls into a deep, magical sleep.
6. Channels III * - As Channels I ,  except a 1st-3rd level spell may be transmitted.
7. Channel Opening I - Caster can open a channel with any 1 known being the caster is acquainted with. This spell will enable the  caster  to  learn  the  specific  location  (direction  and  distance only) of the other being, making it possible for the caster to use a Channels spell. Note that this spell does not allow any sort of communication, although the target will know that a Channel has been opened to him.
8. Dark Blinding - [RR Mod.: -10] Caster points his arm (elbow locked and fist clenched) at the target and channels raw power. The target is blinded.
9. Repel Holy III - As Repel Holy I , except affects up to Type III or 15th level targets.
10. Black Channel I - Caster may cast one of the Black Channel I spells (see Section 10.7).
11. Channels V * - As Channels I , except a 1st-5th level spell may be transmitted.
12. Repel Holy IV - As Repel Holy I , except affects up to Type IV or 20th level targets.
13. Absolution - [RR Mod: -20] Target's 'soul' is torn from the target's body (or other physical location if the soul is otherwise housed); it remains in whatever place 'souls' go for 1 week/10 failure. The soul can be returned early only through Lifegiving or Reuniting . Target is unconscious until soul is restored; even sub -conscious activity (i.e., healing, etc.) suffers a -75 penalty.
14. Dark Channel - The next Channels spell cast by the caster of this spell may be sent to anyone, regardless of the realm of the other individual. However, the spell channeled must be from an Evil spell list.
15. Black Channel II - Caster may cast one of the Black Channel II spells (see Section 10.7).
16. Channel Opening II - As Channel Opening I , except range is 10 miles per level.
17. Channels VII * - As Channels I , except a 1st-7th level spell may be transmitted.
18. Repel Holy VI - As Repel Holy I , except affects up to Type VI or 30th level targets.
19. Channels X * - As Channels I , except a 1st-10th level spell may be transmitted.
20. Absolution Pure - [RR Mod: -20] As Absolution , except the 'soul' can only be brought back through Lifegiving .
25. Black Channel III - Caster may cast one of the Black Channel III spells (see Section 10.7).
30. Dark Absolution - [RR Mod: -20] As Absolution , except the 'soul' is utterly destroyed.
35.  Lord  Channels * - As Channels I ,  except  a  1st-20th  level spell may be transmitted.
40. Channel Opening III - As Channel Opening I , except range is 100 miles per level.
50. Unholy Bridge - Opens a direct channel to the caster's deity (or other power source); results depend on the deity's personality, motives, and powers. Any spell the deity can cast may be transmit -ted through the gate.

Note : The desires of demons vary just as those of mortals do, but they gen -erally desire freedom upon the mortal plane, blood, and material goods of significant value. Their price for aid varies depending on what is asked, the kind and individual personality of the demon, and other factors. A foolish bargain can rebound on the caster. Some demons deal in 'souls', but as such can only be offered once, one should haggle most carefully before making that trade.

A demon can only be affected by one Unleash Demon spell during any one stay on a given plane.

See more about dealing with summoned demons in Section 10.3.

Because of the extremely strong and intimate bond created between cast -er and familiar, any attempt to dispel this bond suffers a penalty of 100 (normally a +100 bonus to the bond's RR against the dispelling attempt).

  

1. Demonic Lore - Caster's mind is filled with dark secrets tugging at his subconscious mind. Any Lore or Science maneuvers on a demon-related topic are made by the caster with a +25 bonus.

2. Oath of Binding - Caster and one demon seal an agreement whereby this spell binds both of them to keep the bargain they have made. The spell will last until the bargain expires due to a time limit agreed upon or simply no longer applies. It is extremely hard to break this spell; it receives a +100 to its RR to resist any form of Dispel or other magic to remove or nullify it. The two parties to the agreement cannot attempt to circumvent the Oath without triggering the punishment for violation of the bargain. Upon any violation of the bargain, the offending party takes an E Holy critical, then on the following round takes a D Holy critical and so on until taking an A Holy critical on the fifth round. These criticals are not modified by size.

3. Demonic Mission I - Allows a demon to stay on this plane while it per -forms a mission for the caster. Caster and demon must have already made the Oath of Binding .  Duration is until the demon fulfills its mission (and returns to the caster if it has not yet received its reward and the mission has left it away from the caster), its mission ends in failure (e.g., the item it was sent to fetch is destroyed), or the maximum duration of 1 hour per caster level has elapsed. While this spell is active, the demon can only pursue its mission (or return to the caster once the mission is completed). When this spell ends, unless some other spell allows the demon to stay, it will return to its home plane after a grace period of 1 minute per level of the demon.

4. Familiar Spirit I - For a period of one week, the caster must cast this spell and spill some of his own blood (taking 1-10 hits of damage in the pro -cess) each day. At the end of that week, the caster will have attracted a Stage I familiar spirit into this world and established a bond to it. See Section 10.3 for details on the familiar spirit and its relationship to the caster.

5. Diabolical Skill I - Caster gains a +25 bonus to his choice of any one Composition, Crafting, Lore, Medical, Performance Art, or Vocation skill. This bonus lasts until the caster casts another Diabolical Skill spell (only one Diabolical Skill spell may be active at one time), the caster touches or is touched by a Holy object (includes Unholy object if the Unholiness is as -sociated with a dark god rather than a demon), is on sacred ground, or is af -fected by any non-Informational spells from a non-Evil user of Channeling.

6. Demonic Vision I - Allows caster to observe any location on the same plane in a pool of blood (blood must not have congealed; spell will prevent congealing during spell duration). This spell has no limits on distance and can focus in on any known place, being, or object that the caster is person -ally familiar with or can describe well enough to uniquely identify. It is sub -ject to magical protections against information spells and such protections are automatically successful. This spell is also unable to reveal anything on holy ground, though it can spy upon holy objects.

7. Demonic Mission II - As Demonic Mission I , except maximum duration is 1 day per caster level.

8. Familiar Spirit II - This spell must be cast on the caster's Stage I fa -miliar spirit every day for two weeks. At the end of that time, more of the spirit's  strength will have been drawn from its own plane, allowing it to manifest as a Stage II familiar spirit. See Section 10.3 for the various Stages of the familiar spirit.

9. Diabolical Skill II - As Diabolical Skill I , except bonus is +50.

10. Unleash Demon I - Frees a demon from any constraining Conjuring Circle and allows it to remain for 10 minutes per caster level until it returns to its home plane.

11. Demonic Vision II - As Demonic Vision I , except allows the caster to hear what is going on at the site looked upon.

12. Familiar Spirit III - As Familiar Spirit II , except the caster's Stage II familiar becomes Stage III in a three week process.

13. Demonic Mission III - As Demonic Mission I , except maximum dura -tion is 1 week per caster level.

14. Diabolical Skill III - As Diabolical Skill I , except bonus is +75.

15.  Demonic Vision  III - As Demonic Vision II ,  except  caster  sees  the scene as if it were well lit, even if it is in total darkness.

16. Familiar Spirit IV - As Familiar Spirit II , except the caster's Stage III familiar becomes Stage IV in a four week process.

17. Unleash Demon II - As Unleash Demon I , except duration is 1 hour per caster level.

18. Demonic Mission IV - As Demonic Mission I , except maximum dura -tion is 1 year per caster level.

19. Diabolical Skill IV - As Diabolical Skill I , except bonus is +100.

20. Familiar Spirit V - As Familiar Spirit II , except the caster's Stage IV familiar becomes Stage V in a five week process.

25. Unleash Demon III - As Unleash Demon I , except duration is 1 day per caster level.

30. Familiar Spirit VI - As Familiar Spirit II , except the caster's Stage V familiar becomes Stage VI in a six week process.

35. Cheat Death - This spell is used only once, if ever. Using it, the caster transforms himself into a Lich, one of the most feared of the undead. If the caster fails when attempting this spell, he will simply die. With success, the caster becomes one of the undead without ever actually dying. At this point, the caster is sustained by magic and dwells in a place between life and death.

40. Unleash Demon IV - As Unleash Demon I , except duration is 1 week per caster level.

50. Cheat Death True - As Cheat Death , except caster's organs are trans -ferred into a ready container (jar, box, chest, etc.). The caster then becomes a somewhat more powerful Classic Lich and can only be truly destroyed if the container with his organs is destroyed.

Note : Statements about how long the demon can remain on this plane are based on the demon having arrived by means of a Summon Demon spell. If the demon arrived by some other means, it may well be able to stay longer.

See Creature Law for much more on demons and Section 10.3 of this volume for more on demon summoning.

  

1. Conjuring Circle I - Caster empowers a circular diagram (a simple pentacle will suffice, but many prefer something more elaborate) of between five and ten feet in radius to confine a demon within its bor -ders. This conjuring circle will prevent any Type I demon from leaving or attacking (including casting any spells or using other magical abili -ties) across this circle. If a demon is left in the circle until the duration expires, the demon is freed and may spend 1 minute per demon level on this plane before returning to its home plane.

2. Banish Demon I - One Type I demon is instantly banished back to the plane whence it came. If the demon is currently confined to a Conjuring Circle , it makes its RR with a penalty of -25.

3. Summon Demon I - Summons a Type I demon which appears at a point within range designated by the caster (within a Conjuring Circle is usually a good idea). It takes the demon two rounds to materialize, during which it is possible to identify the kind of demon appearing (using Creature Lore: Demon). If the demon is not within a Conjuring Circle ,  it  may  do  as  it  wishes  and  can  remain  for  1  minute  per demon level before vanishing back to its home plane. If it is within a Conjuring Circle it  remains  there  until  something  causes  it  to  be released or banished. When casting this spell, the caster must roll a Spell  Mastery maneuver (difficulty Easy). If the Spell Mastery is a Success, the kind of demon that appears is up to the caster; in the case of Absolute Success, the caster may select what level the demon is from the possible range of levels for that kind of demon (or specify a particular demon, if one is known). Partial Success means that the caster knows what kind of demon he is getting (does not need to at -tempt Creature Lore: Demon). Failure means a random demon of the correct Type is summoned. Absolute Failure means that the caster has summoned a random demon of the next higher Type (in the case of Demon Summoning I , this would be a Type II demon).

4. Control Demon I - Demon obeys the caster for the duration of this spell. The demon vanishes back to its home plane at the end of this spell. If the demon is trapped within a Conjuring Circle , it makes its RR with a -25 penalty. However, if the demon succeeds in its RR, it is freed from any confinement and may stay in this world for 1 minute per level of the demon. A failed control attempt will usually anger a demon. This spell affects demons of Type I only.

5. Conjuring Circle II - As Conjuring Circle I , except will confine a demon of Type II or lower.
6. Banish Demon II - As Banish Demon I , except a demon of Type II or lower may be banished.
7.  Summon Demon II - As Summon Demon I ,  except  summons a demon of Type II and the required Spell Mastery roll is of Light dif -ficulty.
8. Control Demon II - As Control Demon I , except a demon of Type II or lower may be controlled.
9. Conjuring Circle III - As Conjuring Circle I , except will confine a demon of Type III or lower.
10. Banish Demon III - As Banish Demon I , except a demon of Type III or lower may be banished.
11. Summon Demon III - As Summon Demon I , except summons a demon of Type III and the required Spell Mastery roll is of Medium difficulty.
12. Control Demon III - As Control Demon I ,  except  a  demon of Type III or lower may be controlled.
13. Conjuring Circle IV - As Conjuring Circle I , except will confine a demon of Type IV or lower.
14. Banish Demon IV - As Banish Demon I , except a demon of Type IV or lower may be banished.
15. Summon Demon IV - As Summon Demon I ,  except  summons a demon of Type IV and the required Spell Mastery roll is of Hard difficulty.
16. Control Demon IV - As Control Demon I ,  except  a  demon of Type IV or lower may be controlled.
17. Conjuring Circle V - As Conjuring Circle I , except will confine a demon of Type V or lower.
18. Banish Demon V - As Banish Demon I , except a demon of Type V or lower may be banished.
19. Summon Demon V - As Summon Demon I ,  except summons a demon of Type V and the required Spell Mastery roll is of Very Hard difficulty.
20. Control Demon V - As Control Demon I , except a demon of Type V or lower may be controlled.
25. Conjuring Circle VI - As Conjuring Circle I , except will confine a demon of Type VI or lower.
30. Banish Demon VI - As Banish Demon I , except a demon of Type VI or lower may be banished.
35. Summon Demon VI - As Summon Demon I , except summons a demon of Type VI and the required Spell Mastery roll is of Extremely Hard difficulty.
40. Control Demon VI - As Control Demon I ,  except  a  demon of Type VI or lower may be controlled.

50. Summon Demon True - As Summon Demon I , except summons a demon of greater than Type VI and the required Spell Mastery roll is of Sheer Folly difficulty, but since this is the most powerful class of demons, an Absolute Failure is the same as a normal failure. Note that demons this powerful cannot be controlled like those of lesser power, so this is a spell to consider carefully before using.

Note : It is an Easy maneuver with an appropriate medical skill to rec -ognize any of these afflictions as the result of magic rather than natural disease.

When selecting allergies, the caster cannot choose something that the target is in constant contact with. For example, the caster cannot choose for the target to be allergic to himself, air, dirt, etc.

Once caught, diseases cannot be dispelled with Dispelling spells. How -ever, they can be cured by Undisease or Remove Disease spells.

Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  diseases  gained  through  this  list  are  not contagious.

Unless stated otherwise, disease effects kick in d10 hours after the spell is cast.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Chills - Target gets a cold. Treat as a mild Pneumonic disease that does not go away. (See RMCL , Section 15.6.)
2. Gray Vision - Target is color blind.
3. Smelling Loss - Target has no sense of smell. Target never perceives by smell alone and suffers a -25 modifier to all Awareness maneuvers involving smell and other senses.

4. Hearing Loss - Target has no sense of hearing. Target never perceives by hearing alone and suffers a -25 modifier to all Awareness maneuvers involving hearing and other senses.

5. Tongue Rot - Over the course of one week, the target's tongue will rot away. When the tongue is fully gone, the target will be unable to speak.

6. Asthma -  Target  gets  severe  asthma.  For  every  round  of  physical exersion (e.g., running or melee combat), the target must make an En -durance roll.

7. Leprosy - Target gets leprosy. This causes a gradual loss of feeling (and blood flow) in the extremities. Every day, the target suffers a cu -mulative -1 penalty to all perceptions involving touch to a maximum of  -25.  There  is  similarly  a  cumulative  -1  penalty  added  each  day  to any roll depending on the target's appearance (e.g., Charm maneuvers), but the maximum for this penalty is -50. After one week of leprosy, all concussion hit damage against the target is halved due to loss of feeling.

8. Minor Allergy - Target becomes slightly allergic to a substance of the caster's choosing. When in the presence of this substance, the target loses 1 AP each round due to the distraction of runny nose, sneezing, etc.

9. Root Rot - The roots of any one plant wither and die and no new roots can be grown. The plant will eventually die.

10.  Hemophilia - The target becomes a hemophiliac. All concussion hits taken by the target are doubled and hits heal at half the normal rate. All attempts to stop bleeding by the target are made with a -30 penal -ty and even magical healing stops one less hit/round of bleeding than would normally be the case.

11. Malaria - The target contracts malaria; after the initial bout of high fever, delerium, coma, and incapacitation (lasting 1 + 2d10 days), the target will be subject to random 'relapses' similar to the initial bout (5% chance each month of a relapse). If the target receives no care during the initial bout, there is a 99% chance of death during this time (only 1% chance if given competent medical attention).

12. Withering Hand - Caster may instantly kill any one plant he touch -es.

13. Epilepsy - Target becomes an epileptic; in a tense situation, there is a 5% chance that he will go into an epileptic fit for 2d10 rounds. If someone is able to provide care (anyone with a rank in Medicine may do so), there is a 1% chance that the target will do an A Krush critical to himself by hitting some object; if there is nobody to do so, there is a 20% chance of taking a critical. In any case, he is treated as stunned (-75).

14. Pneumonia - Target gets pneumonia; if the target is kept warm and completely immobile for 2 weeks, he will have only a 25% chance of dy -ing (50% chance if not treated). The chance of dying is modified by the target's Constitution stat bonus (e.g., if the target has a +7 Constitution stat bonus, his chance of dying if untreated is 43%). If the target survives this two week period, the lingering symptoms are as a mild Pneumonic disease ( RMCL , Section 15.6).

15. Major Allergy - As Minor Allergy , except 2 AP are lost each round.

16. Carrier I - The target suffers any one of the diseases from this list of up to 5th level (caster's choice). In addition, the target is contagious. All who come into contact (5'R) of the target must make an RR (with a +25 modifier if only close to target, +0 if touching target, and at -25 if the individual has intimate contact with the target). If the original target makes his RR, he does not suffer the effects, but must make a second RR or will still be a carrier of the disease. All people who catch the disease from the target are not themselves contagious.

17. Elephantiasis - Target gets elephantiasis; one of his extremities (not his head) swells and grows up to five times normal size. Exact effect should be determined by the GM (but the extremity should be complete -ly useless).

18. Lycanthropy - At the rise of the next full moon, the target becomes a Lesser Werewolf (see Creature Law ).

19. Carrier II - As Carrier I , except disease may be chosen from spells up to 10th level.

20. Leukemia - Target gets leukemia; he will weaken at a rate of 2% per day (-2/day, cumulative, to all activities). When the total reachs 100% (-100 penalty), the target dies.

25. Carrier III - As Carrier I , except disease may be chosen from spells up to 15th level.

30. Rabies - Target gets rabies; after 21 days of no visible effect, the disease sets in. The target's organs contract; he foams at the mouth, be -comes very thirsty and violent; and any one he bites or scratches must resist or contract the disease. The target dies 5-7 days after the disease's onset.

35. Crippling Allergy - As Minor Allergy ,  except 3 AP are lost each round.

40. Lycanthropy True - At the rise of the next full moon, the target becomes a Greater Werewolf (see Creature Law ).

50. Plague - Target gets a 'plague'. If he fails his RR, he will die 95% of the time (after 10 minutes). The other 5% of the time, he believes that he resisted (and suffers no effects), but becomes a carrier instead. Anyone coming within 5' of the carrier must resist (+25 RR; +0 RR if touching the target; -25 RR if in intimate contact with the target) or face the same chances as the original target. Only the original target is contagious.
