### 3. Learning Spells

In any comprehensive world system for a long-running campaign, attention must be paid to magical research. While many abilities are offered by the spells given in Spell Law , there is always the prospect of new spells and it is also possible that some spells or entire lists that  a  Gamemaster rules do not initially exist in the setting might still be developed in the course of play.

Even in a short campaign, consideration must be giv -en to the readiness with which characters may obtain education in existing spell lists.

The following sections contain some suggested rules for conducting research in conjunction with the Spell Law system.

#### 3.1. Learning Existing Spells

Spell lists can be learned from other spell casters (in -cluding supernatural beings and 'monsters'), magical writings (an appropriate Rune [see Rune Mastery list] might  be  studied,  for  example),  or  books  providing instructions  on  the  casting  of  spells  (tomes  and  gri -moires: see Treasure Law for more on written materials). Most religious orders will require learning to cast new spells, unless the GM determines the spells are granted solely by the Channeller's deity or focus. Vari -ous devotional acts or offerings may then be necessary for the gaining of additional Channeling spell knowl -edge. Mentalism spells, especially, might be learned through study of the subject with which the spell list deals (e.g., studying texts on physics of motion in or -der to gain a spell on the Telekinesis list). Of course, the GM is the arbiter whether a spell list is available or not and what the source of it is.

If the spell caster is traveling and is carrying magical texts,  he  will  obviously be limited in the number of lists that are available. Alternatively, if the character has been an apprentice at a large wizard's guild, then he will have access to a great many more.

##### Access to Spell Lists

Simply because a spell list exists does not mean it is readily accessible. Wizards' guilds would guard their secrets, as would an underground association of Ma -gents. Religious orders share their magical skills with the devout, or at least those that have been initiated into  the  religion.  There  are  some  cases  where  orga -nizations will want spells to be widely available and make  them  easy  to  obtain.  For  example,  many  city governments  might  ensure  that  the  low  level  spells creating light are freely available to encourage their use instead of fire for illumination in order to prevent urban fires.

Guilds and organizations may have a particular focus, with skilled spell casters in certain types of lists, and the types of spells available to a channeling user will depend on his god's (or other power source's) sphere of  influence.  Spellcaster  organizations  will  typically have  all  of  a  spell  caster's  base  lists,  assuming  the Profession  is  one  that  the  organization  accepts  (a wizard's  guild  might  accept  Mentalists,  but  exclude Illusionists). Organizations can be rated according to their focus and knowledge of the magical arts:

Minor : Minor groups are quite small (a single Druid acting as a 'group' of one, a trio of Sorceresses on an isolated moor, etc.), poorly resourced, and/or less fo -cused on magic. An organization of criminals might be large and financially able, but only dabble in mag -ically assisting their operations, thus making them a minor group.

Average : Average groups will tend to be larger, bet -ter resourced, and more focused on magic than minor groups, but still have limitations in some area. A major university would likely be an average group, with con -siderable resources, but with a focus spread over many fields, not just magic. A local guild of spellcasters or an order of Paladins is likely to constitute an average group.

Major :  Major  groups  are  large,  have  excellent  re -sources,  and  are  highly  concerned  with  magic. This would be the level of a national guild of spellcasters, a whole order of Druids, or a university of magic. With the most to offer, such groups will generally demand the most of those to whom they grant access to their knowledge.

If  the  GM  has  not  already  decided  how  spells  are shared in the setting, then use Table 3-1 to determine how many Open and Closed spell lists a guild has ac -cess  to  (and  that  the  character  may  learn). The  #  of spell lists that are available is based on the campaign's Power Level and the  type  of  group  the  character  is affiliated  with.  The  actual  number  within  the  range can  be  determined  by  the  GM  or  by  a  random  roll. These  are  only  guidelines  and  may  not  apply  to  all cases. The GM must consider various factors, and the most important of these are how common magic is in the setting and how secretive or open the keepers of magical knowledge are. Availability of spell lists may vary by region/culture and by realm of magic.

Evil lists are a special case. It may be assumed that if a group deals with a given realm of magic and also delves into Evil magic, then that group has access to all  the  applicable spell lists. GMs who wish to keep Evil magic more restricted may use the numbers given above for Closed lists.

Learning New Spell Lists : New spell lists may only be learned (at character creation or at level advance -ment) if the character has had access to the spell lists.

Advancing in Known Spell Lists : Since a spell list is a related group of spells, advancing in a particular list does not necessarily require access to a source of the spell list. In cases where the new spell is an improved version of a lower level spell the character should be able to learn it regardless. Otherwise, it is up to the GM if the next spell is available or not. However, no more than 1 rank may be taken in this manner before the character will have to get access to the spell list again.

#### 3.2. Spell Research

Spell research is the development of new spells to add to  existing  or  new  spell  lists.  A  powerful  character might research an entire  new  spell  list  and  pass  the knowledge of it on to friends and followers. All of the spell lists in Spell Law are filled up to level 20. There -fore, research can be used to:

-  Add high level spells to existing lists
-  Develop a new list
-  Fill gaps created by spells being removed from the existing lists by GM decision
-  Create a second spell in an already filled slot.

Learning a researched version of a spell that replac -es another spell just effectively creates a new (minor variant) list, but learning a 'doubled up' spell at a slot where you already know a spell (e.g., another 7th level spell  on  Fire  Law  when you already have a spell at that level) costs x2 DP for learning a rank in that list normally. A third spell in the same slot is x4, a fourth is  x8,  etc.  This  increased  cost  does  not  apply  to  the individual who originally researched the spell, nor his assistants. They have already paid in the investment of spell research.

The cost of learning a spell with a level on a list that has already been learned is always based on the 1st rank development cost and does not count against the ranks developed in a level (as the rank for that level of the list has already been bought and knowledge of the new spell simply takes advantage of that develop -ment).

Learning the first spell that fills a level already paid for costs nothing in DP, but takes one day to learn from instruction.

Example: Tabitha and Targon are both level 30 Magicians and know Fire Law to 30th level (i.e., each has 30 ranks in Fire Law). Tabitha researches a new 23rd level spell for Fire Law. She now knows her new spell. As she has already purchased rank 23 in Fire Law, she does not need to pay for it again. If she already had a 23rd level Fire Law spell from somewhere else, she would need to pay 1 DP for 'doubling up' on 23rd level spells.

Tabitha can now teach this spell to Targon. He will need to spend one day learning the spell, but would spend no DP, as this is a spell whose level he has already paid to develop. If, however, he already had a 23rd level Fire Law spell from somewhere else, he would need to pay 2 DP (1 DP x 2 for it being the second spell at that level) for 'doubling up' on 23rd level spells. In either case, he could still develop a 31st rank in Fire Law for 1 DP and a 32nd rank for 2 DP when he advances in level.

##### Limitations

The GM should first determine if the proposed spell is acceptable both in terms of desired game balance and campaign setting. The Gamemaster is the final authority on the inclusion of a researched spell into the game and should examine each prospective spell closely. Game -masters may also wish to introduce their own spell lists or spells to be available for the player characters and non-player characters in their games.

Eligibility to Research : In the first place, a character may  only  research  spells  within  the  character's  own realm (or realms if a Hybrid). The spell may not be of higher  level  than  the  researching  character.  Research on a Base list for another Profession is not normally possible; this happens in very rare cases where whole new  Professions  are  developed,  but  such  rare  and extraordinary  events  must  be  handled  outside  these guidelines. Individual GMs may wish to further restrict what  Professions  may  research  which  lists  (e.g.,  the GM may decide that only Pure spellcasters  have  the depth of knowledge to research Closed lists).

Realm :  The  GM  should  determine  the  realm  of  the proposed  spell  (i.e.,  is  the  spell  an  Essence  spell,  a Mentalism spell, a Channeling spell, or perhaps a hy -brid spell). Certain spell effects are appropriate to more than one realm. If the GM judges that the realm of the character attempting to develop the spell cannot obtain this effect, the character can only learn which realm(s) would actually be appropriate for this spell.

Spell  List :  If  possible,  each  spell  should  be  grouped with  similar  spells,  according  to  their  nature.  After determining  that  the  spell  is  acceptable  and  deciding which  realm  it  fits  into,  the  Gamemaster  (with  help from the researcher) should determine if the spell fits into an existing list. If it does, then this concept is rela -tively easy to research, provided the researcher already knows that spell list. If the spell concept does not fit into an existing spell list, it indicates that research material in this area is going to be less easy to find and more time will have to be spent in learning the new spell. If the spell would only fit on a list which the researching character cannot research spells for (e.g., another Pro -fession's Base list), then the researcher can only learn what list(s) that spell would actually be appropriate for.

Spell Level : The GM must assign a level to the spell, based upon its power and the level of other spells of similar power that the spell user already knows or has available. Note that spells with exactly the same effect often have different levels for different professions and particularly for different realms. If the level of the spell is above the level of the researcher, then the researcher will not be able to learn the spell yet, but may learn the level at which the spell would fit into any list(s) that the researcher might be able to research .

##### Requirements for Spell Research

After satisfying himself that the researcher can learn the spell desired, the GM must establish that the character has access to the research materials necessary (which may well involve payment) and subsistence. Other ac -tivity should be severely curtailed (i.e., the researcher should plan to spend at least 8-10 hours a day doing the research). The researcher may then proceed to study; the total amount of time required is discussed below.

Researching Spells on Known Lists : If the spell is on an existing spell list, the researcher must know the spell list to at least the level of the spell to be researched. The amount of time required for the research is equal to the square of the spell's level plus five days if the spell is on an Open list, ten days if it is on a Closed list, and fifteen days if it is on a Base list. Thus, a seventh-level spell on an Open list would take 7x7+5 = 54 days to research.

Researching Spells NOT on Known Lists : If the spell to be researched is not on a known list, or the researcher does not know that list to a sufficient level,  the  time costs involved are tripled. Thus, a seventh-level spell on an Open list would take (7x7+5)x3 = 162 days to research.

Research  Assistants :  If  additional  characters  would also be eligible to try to attempt to research this list on their own, they can assist the main researcher. This will require them to spend an equal amount of time working on  the  research  and  the  time  each  of  them  spends  is reduced assuming that each assistant counts as 50% of a researcher. That is, with one assistant, 150% work is done for a given time, so time is reduced to two-thirds normal, while with two assistants, work rate is 200% and time is cut in half. The GM will have to determine how  many  workers  to  allow  if  many  assistants  are available. Only so many persons can work on a project effectively.

Impossible  Research :  If  the  spell  is  one  which  the researcher  cannot  actually  research  according  to  the guidelines above, then the researcher should be able to discover this in less time than it takes to actually re -search the spell. The researcher will discover the spell is beyond the researcher's reach after a number of days equal to the level of the spell. If the spell is simply im -possible in the GM's world scheme, the GM will have to judge how difficult this is to determine, but fifty days would be a good default ruling.

##### Successful Research

Upon completing the required research, the researcher rolls  a  Routine  Spell  Mastery  maneuver  for  the  ap -propriate list. Any non-failure result indicates that the spell has been learned. The researcher now knows the spell  (as  do  any  qualified  assistants).  Someone  who has learned this new spell may teach it to an associate. The Gamemaster may wish to eventually allow certain researched spells to become a part of the list system for his world. Depending on the extent of the research, the GM may also consider it a significant event and award Experience Points for it ( RMCL, Section 11.4).

##### What is Research?

These  rules  have  assumed  that  research  consists  of an academic process of looking through various old documents,  making  notes,  comparing  data,  making experimental casting attempts, and the like. For most games,  this  will  do  well,  but  some  Gamemasters may wish to vary research according to the realm of magic involved. In this  case,  the  described  research would suit Essence well, while the other two realms approach  research  differently.  Channeling  research would  be  based  not  on  personal  discovery  of  new magical  information,  but  on  the  earning  of  divine -ly-inspired revelation of new knowledge. Depending on  the  religion,  this  might  involve  fasting,  praying, long vigils, pilgrimage, tending to the poor and sick, self-flagellation,  sacrifices,  or  a  quest  or  quests  to prove one's worthiness. Mentalism research might be a matter of achieving a mental state of enlightenment on  the  subject,  perceiving  the  nature  of  the  desired spell in a flash after lengthy preparation. This could include meditation, trance states, visions, fasting, in -tense  experiences,  creating  an  'ideal  contemplative environment', or any other activities meant to free the mind, improve insight, or explore the subject of the desired  spell.  These  alternative  methods  of  research can be handled with the same rules or with slight mod -ification (e.g., more valuable sacrifices might reduce the time, and doing a quest for one's god replaces time requirements). While more detailed rules may be de -veloped, this suggestion is one for strengthening the individual character of magical realms.

##### Researching Existing Spells

On occasion, a spell will already exist on a spell list which an individual already knows, but the individual is unable to learn it due to lack of a teacher or tome. In such circumstances, the individual may wish to du -plicate the already completed research on that spell in order to learn it. In order to do so, the researcher must already have ranks in the list and these must be at least equal to one less than the spell to be researched. There are otherwise no restrictions on the type of spell that may be researched in this way.

This is a much easier task than original research, as -suming  good  reference  materials  are  available.  The time for the research is calculated as for original re -search,  except  that  the  time  listed  is  in  hours  rather than days. This assumes access to a good library and contact  with  persons  with  relevant  knowledge  (e.g., stoneworkers  when  researching  Stonewall).  Truly exceptional research facilities  could  halve  this  time, while poor materials will double it.

This form of research is quicker than creating a new spell, but the rewards are more limited. The DP cost of the spell must still be paid normally, and if a variant spell had already been learned to fill the slot occupied by  the  spell  newly  researched,  the  increased  DP  as explained above for multiple spells at a given level in a list must be paid unless the previously known spell was the result of the learner's original research. There is  no  glory  to  be  had  in  repeating  existing  research, and  the  spell  thus  learned  has  no  special  value,  so there will be no particular demand for the researcher as a teacher.
