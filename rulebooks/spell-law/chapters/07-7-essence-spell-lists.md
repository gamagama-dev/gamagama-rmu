1. Vibrations I - Causes an object of up to 1 lb. weight to  vibrate  rapidly;  if  the  item  is  fragile,  make  a  breakage check. If it is an object held by a being, the being must make an RR or fumble it (each round).
2. Staying I * - Exerts 5 pound of counterforce on a person or object. Object cannot be moved by Staying alone, which can only be used to counter another force, such as gravity, and it can only exert force in one direction. A person (or other animate target) must win a feat of strength based on their weight vs. the weight capacity of the spell in order to move against the force.
3. Telekinesis I - Caster can move one object at a distance, weighing up to 1 pound, up to 1'/second with no accelera -tion.  If  the  caster  stops  concentration  before  the  duration is  up,  the  object  remains  stationary  as  if  it  had Staying  I thrown on it. If the object is held, resolve any attempt to grab it as a feat of strength based on the weight capacity of the spell vs. the weight of the target holding the object.
4. Vibrations II - As Vibrations I ,  except weight limit is 5 lbs.
5. Staying II * - As Staying I , except force limit is 25 lbs.
6. Telekinesis II - As Telekinesis I , except weight limit is 5 lbs.
7. Vibrations III - As Vibrations I , except weight limit is 25 lbs.
8. Staying III * - As Staying I , except force limit is 125 lbs.
9. Vibrations IV - As Vibrations I , except weight limit is 50 lbs.
10. Aiming - Causes +50 to be added to the attack roll of the missile. The caster must touch the firer and see the mis -sile for the entire round that the missile is fired.
11.  Telekinesis  III - As Telekinesis  I ,  except  the  weight limit is 25 lbs.
12. Staying IV * - As Staying I , except the force limit is 250 lbs.
13. Mass Vibrations I - As Vibrations I , except as many 5 lb. objects as the caster's level can be vibrated (they must all be within the field of vision of the caster).
14. 14 Telekinesis IV - As Telekinesis I , except weight limit is 50 lbs.
15. Staying V * - As Staying I , except force limit is 500 lbs.
16. Hurling I - Caster may 'hurl' one object (that starts within 10' of the caster) of 1 lb. or less with sufficient force to deliver an attack on the Sling Attack Table with the rang -es of a Short Bow. Base the caster's OB on his directed spell skill with this spell. If a weapon is 'hurled', a medium Spell Mastery maneuver will allow use of the weapon's normal attack table, retaining the Short Bow range penalties. If this is done, the weapon gets any normal OB bonuses (e.g., from superior materials).
17. Telekinesis V - As Telekinesis I , except weight limit is 100 lbs.
18. True Vibrations - As Vibrations I , except weight limit is 10 lbs./level.
19. Mass Vibrations III - As Vibrations I , except as many 25  lb.  objects  as  the  caster's  level  can  be  vibrated  (they must all be within the field of vision of the caster).
20. Lord Aim - As Aiming , except missile attack bonus is +100.
25. True Staying * - As Staying I , except force limit is 50 lbs./level.
30. True Telekinesis - As Telekinesis I , except weight limit is 10 lbs./level.
35. Mass True Vibrations - As Mass Vibrations I , except objects may be up to 10 lbs./level in weight.
40. Mass Telekinesis - As True Telekinesis , except within the weight limit, the caster may simultaneously manipulate up to one object for every five caster levels (i.e., a 40th level caster could control eight objects at once).
50. Aim True - As Aiming , except missile attack automat -ically  does  maximum  damage  (roll  the  critical  normally, except that it is treated as Slaying II).

Note :  The  'Presence'  ability  detects  minds  of  better than animal intelligence (i.e., creatures with the 'An -imalistic'  or  'Mindless'  flaws  are  not  detected). The caster will be aware of proximity to within 10' distance, and a 1 AP action will provide general direction (above, below, left, right, before, or behind) to one mind. If a detected mind belongs to a seen and recognized (as intelligent) being, then the caster will be able to identify the detected mind as belonging to that being.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Touchless Feel - Caster can pick a point up to 10' away and experience tactile sensations as if their hand was  in  that  place,  able  to  move  as  their  hand  might. The point may be on the other side of a barrier (e.g., in  a  chest,  behind  a  door),  but  cannot  move  through solid objects from that starting point. Sensations of in -tense heat or cold will not cause pain, nor will touching something painful to the touch produce more than a dull ache (i.e., painful sensation is muted). Target cannot be moved and cannot feel the 'touch'.
2. Presence - Caster is aware of the presence of all sen -tient/thinking beings within 20'.
3.  Listen  I -  Caster  can  pick  a  point  up  to  10'  away and will hear as if physically at that point (there can be intervening objects such as walls). Note that this means that the caster does not have hearing at his own location.
4.  Smell I - As Listen I ,  except  the  caster's  sense  of smell functions from the fixed point.
5. Long Ear I - Caster's point of hearing may be moved independently up to 100' away (moves at 10'/md); the caster must be physically able to go there (e.g., the cast -er could not send this point of hearing through walls or closed doors). Note that this means that the caster does not have hearing at his own location.
6. Watch I - As Listen I , except the caster sees from the fixed point (it can rotate).
7. Long Eye I - As Long Ear I , except the caster sees from the moving point (it can rotate).
8. Listen II - As Listen I , except the range is 100'.
9.  Long Nose I - As Long Ear I ,  except  the  caster's sense of smell functions from the moving point.
10. Telepathy - Caster can read the surface thoughts of one target.
11. Watch II - As Watch I , except the range is 100'.
12. Long Ear II - As Long Ear I , except the range is 300'.
13. Smell II - As Smell I , except the range is 100'.
14. Listen III - As Listen I , except the range is 500'.
15. Long Eye II - As Long Eye I , except the range is 300'.
16. Broaden Sense - One of the caster's senses has an extended spectrum of sensitivity. Vision may be extend -ed into infrared or ultraviolet light or hearing extended into infrasonic or ultrasonic frequencies. Applicability to any other sense is up the Gamemaster.
17. Long Nose II - As Long Nose I , except the range is 300'.
18. Watch III - As Watch I , except range is 500'.
19. Smell III - As Smell I , except range is 500'.

Note :  If  more  that  one  option  can  be  added  to  the Illusion or Phantasms spell, the same option can be chosen more than once. For Example - with an Illusion III ,  two  options are available. The range could be doubled once to 200' and then doubled again to 400'.

Illusions are one of the more complex and subtle types of magic and they are explained at length in Section 10.10.

  

1. Ventriloquism - Caster can speak and the caster's voice will appear to come from any point desired within 100' (point must be in the caster's field of vision).
2.  Sound/Light  Mirage -  Creates  any  simple,  immobile  im -age/scene in an area of up to 10'R, or creates a set of immobile sounds in an area of up to 10'R.
3. Taste/Smell Mirage - As Sound/Light Mirage , except it cre -ates a set of immobile smells/scents in the area of effect, or a set of immobile tastes in the area of effect.
4. Illusion II - Creates a simple, immobile image or scene up to  an  area  of  10'R.  One  of  the  following  options  may  also  be chosen: a) an extra sense can be added (not the tactile or Pres -ence senses), b) the duration can be doubled, c) the range can be doubled, d) the radius of the area of effect can be doubled, or e) the illusion can cast light. All parts of the area of effect must be in the caster's field of vision at the time of casting.
5.  Phantasms  I -  Creates  the  image  of  one  object  or  being that will move however the caster wants (as long as the caster concentrates). When the caster stops concentrating, the  image remains but stops moving. The caster may resume concentration again  later,  and  make  the  image  move  again  (presuming  that the duration has not expired). The image can be of any size that would fit in a 10'R.
6. Light Glamour - One object (up to 10 pounds per level) has its visual appearance altered for the duration of the spell. Note that  no  other  aspect  of  the  object  changes.  This  spell  cannot make an object cast light (although it may alter the appearance of light given off, whether naturally or from another spell).
7. Waiting Illusion II - As Illusion II , except it can be delayed by up to 24 hours. At the time of casting, the caster must decide upon the trigger for the spell. The caster can chose one of the following: a) time period, b) specified movements, c) specified sounds, d) specified smells, or e) specified tastes. If a sense is used to trigger the spell, that sense must be included in the illu -sion.
8. Illusion III - As Illusion II , except two options can be chosen. See notes above for guidelines on how to combine the options.
9. Phantasms II - As Phantasms I , except one of the following options may also be chosen: a) an extra sense can be added (not the tactile or Presence senses), b) the duration can be doubled, c) the range can be doubled, d) the radius of the area of effect can  be  doubled, e) another  image  can  be  created  and  moved independently of the first  (all  separate  images  must  be  within the caster's field of vision and within range of the spell), f) the phantasm can cast light, or g) limited repetitious sounds, move -ments, etc., can be added that do not require concentration of the caster (the proper senses involved must also be included within the illusion).
10. Waiting Phantasms II - As Phantasms II , except it can be delayed as in Waiting Illusion II . The phantasm will move and act if given a simple command (at the time of casting) or it can deliver a short speech (if sound was one of the included senses).
11.  Waiting  Illusion  III - As Waiting  Illusion  II ,  except  two options can be chosen. See notes above for guidelines on how to combine the options.
12. Phantasms III - As Phantasms II , except two options can be chosen.
13. Illusion V - As Illusion III , except four options.
14. Waiting Illusion IV - As Waiting Illusion III , except three options can be chosen.
15. Waiting Phantasms III - As Phantasms III , except it can be delayed as in Waiting Phantasms II .
16. Waiting Illusion V - As Waiting  Illusion  III ,  except  four options can be chosen.
17. Phantasms IV - As Phantasms II , except three options can be chosen.
18. Waiting Phantasms IV - As Phantasms IV , except it can be delayed as in Waiting Phantasms II .
19. Illusion VII - As Illusion III , except six options.
20. Waiting Illusion VI - As Waiting Illusion III ,  except five options can be chosen.
25. Phantasms V - As Phantasms II , except four options.
30. Illusion X - As Illusion III , except nine options.
35. Waiting Illusion X - As Waiting Illusion III ,  except  nine options can be chosen.
40. Illusion XV - As Illusion III , except fourteen options.
50. Phantasms X - As Phantasms II , except nine options.

1. Spell Store - Caster may cast this spell with another spell in  order  to  store  that  second  spell. The  spell  to  be  stored must be cast within one minute after the Spell Store spell is cast. The stored spell may then be cast later as an instan -taneous spell.

12. Rune VI - As Rune I , except caster can inscribe 1st-6th level spells.
13. Sign of Fear - [RR Mod: -20] As Sign of Shock , except target will flee the sign's location for 1 min/5 failure. Note that  the  target's  RR  is  made  against  Essence,  not  against Fear.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Protection I - Target gains a bonus of +5 to RRs against spells and a bonus of +5 to DB against elemental attacks.
2. Cancel Essence * - When the caster of this spell is the target of a spell from the realm of Essence, the 'incoming' spell must first make an RR before the caster makes an RR. If  the  'incoming'  spell  passes  the  RR,  it  may  target  the caster of this spell normally; otherwise the incoming spell has no effect on this target. Being a 'willing target' does not eliminate this effect, but the caster's own spells do not need to make an RR. Note that the caster is considered to be a target of any spell which includes him in its area of effect or would 'detect' him.
3. Protection Sphere I - As Protection I , except all beings within  10'R  of  target  (sphere  moves  with  target)  get  the benefits.
4. Cancel Mentalism * - As Cancel Essence , except it af -fects spells from the realm of Mentalism.
5. Protection II - As Protection I , except bonuses are +10.
6.  Cancel  Channeling  * - As Cancel Essence ,  except  it affects spells from the realm of Channeling.
7. Protection Sphere II - As Protection Sphere I ,  except bonuses are +10.
8.  Cancel Essence Sphere I * - As Cancel Essence ,  ex -cept for the area of effect (centered on and moving with the caster). Any spell targeting inside the area of effect may be canceled. If the radius encounters an already existing spell, that spell must make an RR (with a +30 modifier) or be neu -tralized within the sphere (so long as it is within the sphere).
9. Essence Shield - Creates a shimmering shield in front of the caster: it provides a bonus to the caster's RR or DB of 10 against all frontal Essence spell attacks on the caster (force and elemental). If the caster takes an instantaneous action to do so, he can 'deflect' one spell attack. This results in adding the caster's ranks in this list to his RR or, for spells that use an attack table, to his DB (in addition to the basic bonus of 10 for having the Shield). Multiple deflections can be done in a single round, but each is a separate instanta -neous action (costing 1 AP for every instantaneous action after the first).
10. Mentalism Shield - As Essence Shield , except it is ef -fective only against Mentalism spells.
11. Protection III - As Protection I except bonuses are +15.
12.  Cancel  Mentalism Sphere I * - As Cancel Essence Sphere I , except it affects spells from the realm of Mental -ism.
13.  Channeling Shield - As Essence Shield ,  except  it  is effective only against Channeling spells.
14. Spell Shield II - As Essence Shield , except it is effec -tive against any two of the three realms.
15.  Protection  IV - As Protection  I ,  except  bonuses  are +20.
16. Cancel Channeling Sphere I * - As Cancel Essence Sphere I ,  except it affects spells from the realm of Chan -neling.
17.  Cancel  Essence  Sphere  II  * -  As Cancel  Essence Sphere I , except for radius.
18. Spell Shield True - As Essence Shield , except it is ef -fective against all three realms.
19. Protection V - As Protection I , except bonuses are +25.
20. Essence Resistance - Target gets a +50 bonus for all RRs vs. Essence spells.
25. Mentalism Resistance - Target gets a +50 bonus for all RRs vs. Mentalism spells.
30. Channeling Resistance - Target gets a +50 bonus for all RRs vs. Channeling spells.
35. Cancel Magic Sphere II * - As Cancel Essence Sphere I , except that it affects spells from any realm of magic, and has an enhanced radius.
40. Cancel Magic Sphere V * - As Cancel Magic Sphere II , except for radius.
50.  Resistance True - As Essence Resistance ,  except  all three realms are affected.

Note :  See  Section 10.14 regarding the use of spells from this list on varying qualities of locks and traps.

  

1. Lock * - Caster can cause any lock visible within 100' to be locked (the lock is just normally locked and can be opened normally).
2.  Magic Lock - A door (or container) can be magically 'locked'. The door can be broken normally or the spell can be dispelled; otherwise, the door cannot be opened.
3. Locklore - Gives the caster a +20 bonus for picking the lock analyzed. If the caster takes a round to explain the lock to someone else, that person gets a +10 bonus to pick the lock.
4. Opening I - When cast on a lock there is a 20% chance a normal lock will open, and a 45% chance that a Magic Lock will open (failure means there is a 10% chance of setting off attached traps). Rolls are open-ended, and the quality of the lock may modify the roll (given percentage assumes a 'Medium' quality lock).
5.  Traplore -  As Locklore ,  except  applies  to  disarming traps.
6.  Disarm  I - As Opening I ,  except  its  chances  concern disarming traps.
7.  Jamming -  Causes  a  door  to  expand  and  jam  into  its frame  (roll  1-100:  severity  ranges  from  slightly  stuck  to unopenable).
8. Weakening - Reduces the inherent strength of a door. All attempts to force or break through the door get a +50 bonus; Breakage Rolls for the door are made at -50.

35. Bypass Traps - All traps in the radius of effect have a 95% chance of failing to operate. Once the spell duration is over or the trap is outside the effect radius, the trap will function normally. This does require that the trap have some mechanism involved. A pit trap with a trap door opening will fail, but a pit simply covered over with some branches will still not support any more weight than normal.
40. Open Prison True - As Lock Mastery and Trap Mastery , except applies to every lock and trap within the radius of effect.
50. Gate Cleaver - Caster can utilize any one of the lower level spells on this list each round.

Note : A Hybrid spell will be affected by a Cancel, Dispel , or Shield spell that is effective against either of its hybrid -ized  realms. Unessence, Unmentalism ,  and Unchanneling remove half the PP of a Hybrid using the applicable realm, but do not prevent casting the Hybrid's Base list spells un -less the target's other realm is also negated.

Curses are not affected by regular dispelling. See Section 10.2 for dealing with curses.

  

1. Cancel Essence * - When the caster (of Cancel Essence ) is the target of a spell from the Essence realm, the 'incom -ing' spell must first make a successful RR before the caster needs to make an RR. If the 'incoming' spell passes the RR, it may target the caster normally; otherwise, the incom -ing spell has no effect on this target. Being a 'willing target' does not eliminate this effect, but the caster's own spells do not need to make an RR. Note that the caster is considered to be a target of any spell which includes him in its area of effect or would 'detect' him.
2. Cancel Mentalism * - As Cancel Essence , except it af -fects spells from the realm of Mentalism.
3.  Cancel  Channeling  * - As Cancel Essence ,  except  it affects spells from the realm of Channeling.

Note : See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

All vacuums created by the spells on this list also create a loud noise. The larger  the  radius  the  louder  the  noise. The  GM  may wish to rule that all within the radius must make a second RR or be deafened for 1 round per 10 failure (RR attack level equals the radius of the vacuum).

A Vacuum thrown at a creature made of gas will result in a Slaying IV Critical on the creature.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Whispering Wind - Caster can whisper and the air will carry his words to one person within range.
2. Path of Calm * - A missile within 10' of the caster is given calm air around it throughout its flight, allowing it to ignore all penalties due to wind, including magical air movement (e.g., an Airwall).
3.  Fog Making - Creates a dense fog within the area of effect. Treat as a heavy fog as described in RMCL Section 15.7.
4. Airwall - Creates a wall of dense churning air up to 10'x10'x3'. This  wall  requires  1  AP  to  cross,  the  pace  of  anyone  moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by one (e.g, a Run going in would be a Jog coming out), and attacks through the wall suffer a -50 penalty.
5. Waterwall - Creates a wall of water up to 10'x10'x1'. This wall requires 2 AP to cross, the pace of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by two (e.g, a Run going in would be a Walk pace coming out) to a minimum of a Walk, and attacks through the wall suffer a -80 penalty.
6. Guiding Wind I * - A missile launched from within 10' of the caster is aided by a wind that leads it towards its intended target. This provides a +10 bonus to the missile attack. This cannot be combined with Path of Calm .
7. Unfog - Disperses fog within the area of effect. If not all of a fog is dispersed (i.e., the fog covers a greater area than the area of effect for this spell), the fog will refill the area of effect, reducing the cleared radius by 10' every 1-5 minutes (varying depending on the heaviness of the fog and ambient humidity).
8. Water Bolt I - A bolt of water is shot from the caster's palm; results are determined on the Water Bolt Table.
9. Quench - Target's fluids are immediately replenished, eliminat -ing any dehydration that the target may have been suffering. This spell  also  meets  the  target's  water  needs  for  the  next  24  hours, not including losses directly due to magic (i.e., it will not defend against a Dessication spell, but will cure its effects if cast after).
10. Vacuum I - Creates a 5' radius of near vacuum; all within the radius take a B Impact critical as the air leaves and rushes back in (if they fail an RR).
11. Guiding Wind II * - As Guiding Wind I , except bonus is +20.
12. Waterwall True - As Waterwall , except caster need not con -centrate and the duration is 1 minute per level.
13. Calm Water - All water within a 100'R is calmed; waves are cut by 20' in the center and less towards the perimeter. This will negate the effects of currents in the area of effect.
14.  Purify  Fluid -  By  concentrating,  the  caster  can  convert  a liquid that is mostly water into pure water or a gas that is mainly breathable air into fresh air. If purifying a liquid, the caster can pu -rity a cubic foot per round of concentration. If purifying a gas, the caster can purify 10' cubed (i.e., 1000 cubic feet) each round. The purification has a permanent effect; the duration of Concentration is purely a matter of continuing purification.
15. Water Bolt III - As Water Bolt I , except range increment is 75'.
16. Vacuum II - As Vacuum I , except radius is 10'.
17. Guiding Wind III* - As Guiding Wind I , except bonus is +30.
18. Wind Control - Caster can control the speed and direction of the wind. Caster can increase or decrease wind speed by 1 mph per caster level (e.g., if the wind speed is normally 20 mph, a 15th level caster could alter the wind speed to between 5 and 35 mph). By directing the wind against missile attacks the caster can cause a -1 modification for each mph of wind speed. Note that caster can also control the direction of the flow of gases and/or clouds.
19. Water Bolt V - As Water Bolt I ,  except range increment is 125'.
20. Vacuum III - As Vacuum I , except radius is 15'.
25. Guiding Wind True * - As Guiding Wind I , except bonus is +50 and any range penalties are halved.
30. Command Current - The area of effect for this spell is the water  immediately  surrounding  the  boat  that  the  caster  is  on (where 'boat' should be interpreted loosely; a log is a 'boat' for purposes of this spell if the caster is riding it on water). For as long as the caster concentrates, the speed of the boat will be increased by 25' per round (approximately 3 miles per hour).
35. Whirlpool - Creates a whirlpool with a 50 foot radius in any liquid body that will draw in any objects in the liquid up to 500' away.  Objects  capable  of  moving  under  their  own  power  may make a Very Hard Swimming maneuver to resist the pull of the whirlpool.
40. Vacuum VI - As Vacuum I , except radius is 30'.
50. Summon Storm - Summons forces of nature in a fierce thun -derstorm which includes heavy rain, 25-60 mph winds, lightning (random) and a blizzard (if correct climate). Can be delayed up to
26. 1 hour/level after casting.

Note : When allowed to choose more than one option on summon -ing spells, the same option may be chosen more than once. For ex -ample, with a Summons III , two options are available. This means that if both options are used for the same thing, then three first-lev -el creatures could be summoned, or one third-level creature could be summoned, or one first-level creature could be summoned for four times as long.

Because of  the  extremely  strong  and  intimate  bond  created  be -tween caster and familiar, any attempt to dispel this bond suffers a penalty of 100 (normally a +100 bonus to the bond's RR against the dispelling attempt).

  

1.  Familiar - The caster can attune himself to a small creature of animal intelligence (i.e., with the Animalistic flaw) to serve as his familiar. The caster must obtain the creature (which can be no more than 10% of caster's own mass) through normal means and cast  the  spell  on  the  animal  daily  for  1  week  (associating  with the animal for 2 hours each day). The caster can then control the familiar and view the world through its senses by concentrating on it (must be within 50' per caster level). If the animal is killed, the caster will have a -25 modification to all actions for 2 weeks.
2. Summons I - Caster can instantly summon a first level non-in -telligent (i.e., possessing the Animalistic or Mindless flaw) living creature, which appears somewhere within the spell's range. The caster can specify the general type of creature, but exactly what the creature is should be determined randomly (e.g., the caster could specify 'four-legged, hoofed' and could get a zebra, horse, camel, etc.). If the creature can understand the caster's communication, the creature can be controlled by normal communication. Other -wise, control is maintained through concentration of the caster. If the creature summoned is used for a task that is not dangerous (in its own perception), the duration for this spell is 10 minutes per level. However, if the creature is ever put into a dangerous situa -

tion, the duration immediately drops to 1 round per level. At the end of the spell's duration, the summoned creature will disappear back whence it came.

3. Familiar's Bond - While this spell is active, any spell targeting the caster (including 'self' spells) for which the caster is a willing target  will  also  affect  the  familiar.  Note  that  a  familiar  may  not benefit from every possible spell (e.g., even though familiars tend to be smarter than normal for their kind, a familiar would not know what to do with the benefits of Fire Mastery ).
4. Elemental Control I - [RR Mod.: Special, see text] By concen -trating, the caster can control one Grade I elemental. If this spell fails, the elemental will act normally unless it is a spell-caster, in which case it will become hostile (i.e., only a spell-casting ele -mental  will  recognize  a  control  attempt  as  a  hostile  act).  If  the caster of this spell knows the Magician Base list corresponding to the elemental's element, then the caster's ranks in that list are subtracted from the RR. If the caster knows the Closed Essence elemental list corresponding to the elemental's element (e.g. Fluid Elements for Water or Air elements), then the subtraction is half the number of the caster's ranks in that list. Once free of control, the  elemental  will  be  hostile  to  the  caster  if  the  elemental  was placed in danger. A controlled elemental may be commanded to return to its origin; this will take the elemental two rounds. Thus, this spell doubles as a means of banishing elementals.
5. Summons II - As Summons I ,  except the caster chooses one of the following options: a) the level of the summoned creature is increased by one, b) an extra 1st level creature can be summoned, or c) the duration can be doubled. When applying options to the higher level Summons spells, option 'a' can only be applied to one creature at a time (i.e., two 2nd level creatures takes three options: one for the second creature and one each to raise the creatures to 2nd level).
6. Elemental Summons I - Allows the caster to summon a Grade I  elemental.  This  elemental  will  appear  over  the  course  of  two rounds. If uncontrolled after those two rounds are complete, it will act normally according to its nature. Uncontrolled elementals can return to their place of origin at any time, taking two rounds to do so. If the elemental is in a region that is particularly suitable for it (e.g., an Ice elemental summoned to a glacier), it will not return for 1d10 days. If the region is not particularly suitable for it (e.g., an Ice elemental summoned to a temperate forest), it will stay for 1d10 hours. If the region is unsuitable for the elemental (e.g., an Ice elemental summoned to a desert), it will stay for 1d10 minutes. This is normal behavior and if a method of communication exists, or if  there  is  an  obvious  motive to act otherwise, behavior may vary.
7.  Summons  III - As Summons II ,  except  two  options  can  be chosen.
8. Elemental Control II - As Elemental Control I , except that a Grade I or II elemental can be controlled.
9.  Summons V - As Summons III ,  except  four  options  can  be chosen.
10. Elemental Summons II - As Elemental Summons I , except a Grade I or II elemental can be summoned.
11. Summons X - As Summons III , except 9 options can be cho -sen.
12. Elemental Control III - As Elemental Control I , except that a Grade I-III elemental can be controlled.
13. Familiar True - As Familiar , except that there is no limit on the mass of the familiar, and the caster suffers a -50 penalty for two weeks if the familiar is killed.

14. Elemental Summons III - As Elemental Summons I , except an elemental of Grade III or lower can be summoned.

15. Waiting Summons - As Summons X , except it can be delayed up to 1 day/level or until triggered by one of the following (de -cided by the caster at the time of casting): specified movements, sounds, touch, or actions. Trigger must be such as the caster would be able to sense it if still  at  the  location  of  the  spell  effect.   At the time of casting, the caster may specify a single task for the creature(s) to perform when it/they arrive(s).

16. Lord Summons - As Summons III , except 19 options can be chosen.

17. Elemental Control IV - As Elemental Control I , except that a Grade I-IV elemental can be controlled.

18. Lesser Elemental Mastery * - Cast on a Grade I, II, or III elemental that the caster currently controls (through an Elemental Control spell),  this  spell  places  the  elemental  under  the  caster's permanent control. By concentrating, the caster can issue orders to  mastered  elementals,  which  will  continue  to  follow  an  order without the caster's concentration. A mastered elemental receives a +40 to all RRs against attempts to control it by a different caster. However, any elemental will become hostile if this spell is cast on it and the spell does not succeed (and the elemental is no lon -ger under the caster's control and has a +40 bonus to resist new controls). A mastered elemental can be sent away by its master in the  same way as a controlled elemental; this banishment termi -nates the Mastery spell. A  caster  can never have more levels of elementals mastered than his number of ranks in this list (e.g., a caster with 20 ranks in Gate Mastery may be Master of 10 level 2 elementals or 5 level 4 elementals or 2 level 6 elementals and 4 level 2 elementals or some other combination whose total levels do not exceed 20). The range given is only for initial mastery; once mastery is achieved, the caster and the mastered elemental may part without breaking the bond.
19. Elemental Summons IV - As Elemental Summons I , except an elemental of Grade IV or lower can be summoned.
20.  Mass  Summons - As Summons III ,  except  one  option  per caster level is chosen.
25. Elemental Control V - As Elemental Control I , except that a Grade I-V elemental can be controlled.
30. Elemental Summons V - As Elemental Summons I , except an elemental of Grade V or lower can be summoned.
35. Elemental Control VI - As Elemental Control I , except that a Grade I-VI elemental can be controlled.
40. Elemental Summons VI - As Elemental Summons I , except an elemental of Grade VI or lower can be summoned.
50. Greater Elemental Mastery * - As Lesser Elemental Mastery , except Grade I through VI elementals can be mastered.

Note : Only objects totally contained in the radius at the time of casting become invisible. Any object  in  the  radius  is  under  the  restrictions given in Unseen I . See Section 10.11 for more notes on the spells on this list.

  

1. Transparency - A single inanimate object is made nearly invisible, allowing it to be seen through. Object cannot be larger than 10'x10'x3'.
2. Unseen I - A single object is made invisible (1 garment, 1 naked body, etc.); until 24 hrs pass or the object is struck by a violent blow (being hit  by  a  weapon,  falling,  etc.)  or  the  object  makes  a  violent move (i.e., an attack) or casts a spell of type E or F.
3.  Lingering Transparency - As Transparency ,  except  duration  is one minute/level.
4. Invisibility I - As Unseen I , except everything within 1' of the tar -get is invisible as long as it is within the 1'R and none of the Unseen I termination conditions occur.
5. Long Unseen I - As Unseen I , except range is 100'.
6. Invisibility II - As Invisibility I , except the caster can vary the ra -dius up to 1'. This makes the invisible target harder to see by reducing the 'fringe effect'.
7. Unseen Blow * - One melee attack (armed or unarmed) is covered by a moment of invisibility. Unless the target of that attack has the power to see the invisible, the target's parry is subject to a -100 penalty (down to a minimum of 0 parry DB).
8. Invisibility Sphere I - As Invisibility I , except the constant radius is 10'. Note that anything that exits the radius will become visible again.
9. See Invisible I - Caster can see all invisible things anywhere that he can normally see. In addition, he suffers no penalties against invisible targets (as they are not invisible to him).
10. Unseen III - As Unseen I , except 3 objects can be affected.
11. Invisibility Sphere II - As Invisibility Sphere I , except caster can vary the radius up to 10', determined at time of casting.
12. Long Invisibility I - As Invisibility I , except range is 100'.
13. Unseen V - As Unseen I , except 5 objects can be affected.
14. Long Unseen III - As Unseen III , except range is 100'.
15. Split Invisibility - As Invisibility I except two targets can be the center of two separate radii of invisibility.
16. See Invisible II - As See Invisible I , except it allows a target to see invisible things.
17. Unseen X - As Unseen I , except 10 objects can be affected.
18. Split Invisibility Sphere - As Split Invisibility , except the caster can vary the two radii by up to 10'.
19. Unseen Weapon - As Unseen Blow , except affects all melee at -tacks by the target during the spell's duration.
20. Invisibility Sphere III - As Invisibility Sphere II ,  except caster can vary the radius by up to 20'.
25. Mass Unseen - As Unseen I , except as many objects as the cast -er's level may be affected.
30. Mass Invisibility I - As Invisibility I , except as many targets as the caster's level may be the centers of constant 1' radii of invisibility.
35. Mass Invisibility II - As Invisibility II , except as many targets as the caster's level may be the centers of variable radii of invisibility.
40. Mass See Invisible - As See Invisible II , except as many targets as the caster's level may be given the power to see invisible objects.
50. True Invisibility - As Invisibility I , except the caster can vary the radius of invisibility up to 1' and if the caster attacks he is only visible for the 5 seconds immediately following the attack (two instances). Likewise, he may cast a type E or F spell and become visible for the following 5 seconds. Violent blows do not affect this spell.

Note :  Unless otherwise stated, no change is made except to the living target of the spell, excluding items worn or carried, with the sole exception of any prosthetics added by the Lay Healer Base list Prosthetics.

A Size changing spell may be combined with a Change spell to take on a different form at a different Size.

A change in Size category carries with it all the normal advantages and disadvantages of the new Size. For example, for a Medium creature Enlarged to Big, increase their hits by 50%.

See section 10.21 for a discussion of spells with 'Kind' in their name.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Change Lore - Allows caster to analyze the form of another being for future use with Exact Change or Change Self Exact . The caster can only have as many forms analyzed as he has ranks in this list. Caster may choose to forget a form at any time to make room for replacements.
2. Beautify - Caster enhances the target's appearance. The target still looks like himself or herself, but in an idealized way, such as seen in a flattering portrait.
3. Resize Self - Allows caster to grow or shrink within the limits of his Size category.
4. Changing to Kind - Alters the caster's entire body to the form of another humanoid race. The form cannot be that of a particular individual form. For example, a human caster could take the form of a Dwarf, but not the Dwarven High Chancellor. Only the phys -ical form is gained (e.g., a target who becomes a Dwarf would not receive the Dwarves' ability to see in the dark). This spell does not allow the caster to change his Size category, but size may be changed as desired within that limit.
5. Resize Self True - As Resize Self , except that non-magical or -ganic objects held or carried by the caster will change size in the

same proportion as does the caster.

6. Change to Kind - As Changing to Kind ,  except target to be changed need not be the caster.
7. Change Self - As Changing to Kind , except alteration can be to any organic form within the caster's Size category. No special abilities of the form are gained.
8. Resize - Allows caster to grow or shrink the target within the limits of the target's Size category.
9. Change Self True - As Change Self , except that non-magical organic objects held or carried by the caster will refit to the cast -er's new form or merge into his body for the duration, depend on whether the item can readily be adapted to the new form.
10. Change Self Exact - As Change Self , except altered form can be that of a specific being analyzed by Change Lore .
11. Change - As Change to Kind , except alteration can be to any organic form within the target's Size category. No special abilities of the form are gained.
12. Shrink Self - Caster can shrink down to within the limits of one Size category smaller than his own.
13. Exact Change - As Change , except altered form can be that of a specific being analyzed by Change Lore .
14. Enlarge Self - Caster can grow to within the limits of one Size category larger than his own.
15.  Changing  Self - As Change Self Exact ,  except  caster  may assume a different form anytime during the spell, by concentrating for one round/change.
16. Shrink - Target can shrink down to within the limits of one Size category smaller than his own.
17. Merging - Target can merge into any solid, inanimate mate -rial. While merged, target cannot move, perceive, or cast spells. When the target emerges from the material, it is possible to emerge from any side or face of the material, although this is limited to moving 'through' no more than the target's own body size plus two feet worth of material. The target can exit at any time up to the end of spell duration (at which time the target automatically emerges at the entrance point).
18.  Changing - As Exact Change ,  except  target  may  assume  a different form anytime during the spell, by concentrating for one round/change.
19. Enlarge - Target can grow to within the limits of one Size category larger than his own.
20. Passing - Target may pass through any inanimate material up to 1 foot/level. It takes 1 round to pass through 2 feet of material.
25. Mass Resize - As Resize , except it simultaneously enlarges or shrinks as many targets (can be beings or objects) as the caster's level. All targets must change size by the same percentage amount.
30. Mass Change - As Change , except affects up to the caster's level in targets (all targets must take the same type of form).
35. Greater Size Change - Target can shrink or grow within the limits of two Size categories above or below his own.
40. Mass Merging - As Merging , except affects up to the caster's level in targets; all targets exit after a set time or with caster.
50. Mass Passing - As Passing , except affects up to the caster's level in targets.

Note : It should be clear from the spell descriptions, but experience with other game systems may lead to incorrect assumptions, so it should be noted that it is not possible for teleport error to place one inside a solid (or liquid, unless one has intended to teleport into a liquid environment) object. The spell would then fail and the teleporting individual(s) suffer stun (-50) as explained in the description of Long Door I .

Spells that involve teleportation are normally quite noisy and dif -ficult to silence. Air is being pushed about in a manner not unlike a thunderclap. Amount of noise depends on the size of the object teleported.

See Section 10.15 for weight limits for movement spells.

  

1. Leaping * - Allows the target to make one leap up to 50' lateral -ly or 20' vertically (as a separate 1 AP action, with no Pace penalty for the leaping movement) in the round that the spell was cast.
2. Landing * - This spell is cast on a target who is falling and takes  effect  immediately,  allowing  the  target  to  land  safely  in  a fall up to 20' per level of the caster and to take that distance off the severity of any longer fall.
3. Leaving I - Caster teleports target to a point up to 100' away, but there can be no intervening 'barriers' in a direct line between the target and the point. A 'barrier' is anything the target could not physically go through; a closed door is a barrier, a pit is not.
4. Levitation - Allows target to move up and down vertically 10' per round. This spell does not confer any ability to control hori -zontal movement, which must be accomplished by other means.
5.  Fly  I - Allows target to fly at a rate of up to 35'/round (ap -proximately 5 mph). This spell allows free movement in all three dimensions and allows hovering.
6. Portal - Opens a portal 3'x6'x3' in any solid surface, through which anyone can pass. At the end of the duration, the surface is returned to its previous state. Anyone in the area of effect when the spell ends will be forced back out to the point of entry.
7. Fly II - As Fly I , except maximum rate is 75'/round (approxi -mately 10 mph).
8.  Long Door I - As Leaving I ,  except target can pass through barriers  by  specifying  exact  distances.  If  the  arrival  point  coin -cides with solid material, the target does not move, instead being stunned (-50) 1-10 rounds, and the PP for this spell are expended.
9. Leaving III - As Leaving I , except target can be moved 300'.
10. Teleport I - As Long Door I ,  except movement range is 10 miles per level. Making a precise appearance is difficult, especial -ly  if  unfamiliar  with  the  destination. The  following  chances  for error exist: Never seen place (only described) = 50%; been briefly (1 hr) = 25%; Studied (24 hr) = 10%; Studied carefully (1 week) = 1%; Lived in (1 yr) = .01 %. In case of failure: first determine di -rection of error (randomly), then determine amount of error (make an open-ended d100 roll for the number of feet).
11. Fly III - As Fly I ,  except rate is 150'/round (approximately 20 mph).
12. Long Door III - As Long Door I , except movement range is 300'.
13. Teleport III - As Teleport I,  except up to 3 targets may be moved to same place.
14. Portal True - As Portal ,  except portal is 3'x6' and up to 5'/ level deep.
15. Long Door V - As Long Door I ,  except movement range is 500'.
16. Teleport V - As Teleport III , except 5 targets may be moved.
17. Fly True - As Fly I , except rate is 225'/round (approximately 30 mph).
18. Teleport X - As Teleport III , except 10 targets may be moved.
19. Mass Leaving - As Leaving I , except as many targets as the caster's level may be moved.
20.  Lord  Teleport - As Teleport  III ,  except  20  targets  can  be moved.
25. Mass Long Door - As Long Door III , except as many targets as the caster's level may be moved up to 300'.
30. Mass Teleport - As Teleport III , except as many targets as the caster's level may be moved.
35. Mass Fly - As Fly III , except as many targets as the caster's level may fly at 150' per round.
40. Mass Fly True - As Fly True , except as many targets as the caster's level may fly at 225' per round.
50. Teleport True - As Teleport I , except with no movement range limit.

1. Spell Control * - Caster adds +25 to his next Spell Mas -tery maneuver within 1 minute of casting this spell.
2. Extension II - Causes the caster's next spell cast within 1 minute to have double the normal duration. This is not cumulative with any other Extension spell. Only spells with a defined duration can have their duration changed with an Extension spell. This does not include spells with a duration of concentration (C) or -.
3. Enhance Skill * - The caster's next spell (cast within 1 minute of this spell) gains a +25 bonus to the spell-casting roll and to any associated Spell Mastery maneuver.
4.  Lesser  Ranging -  Causes  the  caster's  next  spell  cast within 1 minute to have its range increased by 50'. This is not cumulative with any other Ranging spell.  Only spells with  a  range  greater  than  touch/self  can  have  their  range extended with a Ranging spell. For spells with a range in -crement  (directed  spells),  divide  the  increase  by  5  to  get the change to the increment (e.g., for Lesser Ranging , the increase to a range increment would be 10').
5. Extension III - As Extension II , except duration is three times normal.
6. Instant Lesser Ranging * - As Lesser Ranging , except casting time is instantaneous.
7. Increased Radius I - Causes the caster's next spell cast within 1 minute to have its area of effect increase by 5'R. Obviously, this applies only to spells with a radius effect. This  is  not  cumulative  with  any  other Increased  Radius spell.
8. Ranging I - As Lesser Ranging , except range is increased by 100' (or +20' range increment).
9. Extension IV - As Extension II , except duration is four times normal.
10. Instant Ranging I * - As Instant Lesser Ranging , ex -cept range is increased by 100' (or +20' range increment).
11. Increased Radius II - As Increased Radius I ,  except radius is increased by 10'.
12. Ranging II - As Ranging I , except range is increased by 200' (or +40' range increment).
13. Extension V - As Extension II , except duration is five times normal.
14. Instant Ranging II * - As Instant Ranging I ,  except range is increased by 200' (or +40' range increment).
15. Increased Radius III - As Increased Radius I , except radius is increased by 15'.
16. Increased Size I - Causes the caster's next applicable spell (directed spells and those that do a critical) cast within 1 minute of casting this spell to have its Size increased by one size category (typically Medium to Big).
17. Ranging III - As Ranging I , except range is increased by 300' (or +60' range increment).
18. Extension X - As Extension II , except duration is ten times normal.
19. Instant Ranging III * - As Instant Ranging I , except range is increased by 300' (or +60' range increment).
20. Increased Radius IV - As Increased Radius I , except radius is increased by 20'.
25. Ranging V - As Ranging I , except range is increased by 500' (or +100' range increment).
30. Greater Extension - As Extension II , except duration is increased by 12 hrs.
35. Extension True - As Extension II ,  except duration is increased by 24 hrs.
40. Multienhancement - As Extension X , Ranging III , and Increased Radius II combined.
50. Permanent - As Extension II , except duration is perma -nent. This spell may only be cast once per month. The caster has a random temporary stat decreased by one. This loss may only be recovered by normal stat gain upon gaining a level.

1. Spell Store - Caster may cast this spell with another spell in order to store that second spell. The spell to be stored must be cast within one minute after the Spell Store spell is cast. The stored spell may then be cast later as an instantaneous spell. The Spell Store spell costs the same number of PP as the spell that is stored. No other spell may be cast while a spell is stored.

2. Identify Casting * - If the target of this spell is casting a spell, the caster will know what realm the spell is from and what Type of spell the target is casting.

3. Spell Hold I * - The attack spell that is targeted with this spell must make an RR. If the RR succeeds, it will attack its original target as in -tended; otherwise the effects of the spell are delayed for the duration of this spell. At the end of the duration, if the target of the held spell has moved more than 20', the held spell may randomly affect another target within 10' of the original target point. If a spell is not cast on the original target, the new target gets a +15 RR bonus. Elemental attack spells suffer a -30 modification if not cast upon the original target. An attack spell for purposes of this spell is any spell having a target.

4. Allied Spell Store - As Spell Store , except the spell to be stored may be cast by someone (or something if the spell is cast by an item) other than the caster storing the spell. The PP cost of this spell is three more than that of the spell to be stored (with a minimum cost of 4 PP).

5. Spell Bending I * - Caster can deflect one Bolt , Ball , or Cone of magical origin. The incoming spell must make an RR. If the RR succeeds, it will attack its target normally; otherwise, the attack roll is modified by a penalty equal to the amount by which the RR was failed.

6. Spell Hold II * - As Spell Hold I , except attack spells can be held up to 2 rounds.

7. Bypassable Spell Store - As Spell Store , except other spells may be cast  while  the  stored  spell  remains  in  storage.  However,  such  casting requires an additional PP and the spell-casting roll suffers a -10 penalty. The PP cost of this spell is five more than that of the spell to be stored (with a minimum cost of 7 PP).

8. Spell Bending II * - As Spell Bending I , except attack roll is modified by twice the amount of RR failure.

9. Spell Hold III * - As Spell Hold I , except attack spells can be held 3 rounds.

10. Reverse Spell I * - The target elemental attack spell must make an RR with a modification of +20 (in favor of the elemental attack spell). If the RR succeeds, the attack is made as normal; otherwise, the elemental attack spell is reversed back on its caster with a +0 OB.

11. Spell Bending III * - As Spell Bending I , except attack roll is mod -ified by three times the amount of RR failure.

12. Spell Hold IV * - As Spell Hold I , except attack spells can be held 4 rounds.

13. Power Loan - The caster may 'borrow' Power Points from the days to come. When this spell is cast, the caster regains all Power Points to the caster's normal maximum. Every time the caster casts this spell, he loses all PP for the next two days (the normal duration of the spell). The caster also suffers concussion hit damage equal to 10% of the caster's normal maximum hits. In addition, for the duration of this spell, he will cast spells as if he were one level lower than he actually is. This spell may be cast multiple times (borrowing PP from many days to come), but all effects are cumulative. For example, if cast twice, the caster will lose all PP for the next four days, take 20% of maximum hits in damage, and cast spells at two levels lower than normal. All penalties will remain in effect until the duration of the spell lapses. The next time the caster sleeps, that rest period will be extended by six hours for each casting of this spell and if this sleep is interrupted, the days of no PP will not begin to count down until after the caster has slept for the full required period of normal sleep requirement plus six hours per casting of Power Loan .

14. Spell Bending IV * - As Spell Bending I , except attack roll is mod -ified by four times the amount of RR failure.

15. Spell Hold V * - As Spell Hold I , except attack spells can be held 5 rounds.

16. Reverse Spell II * - As Reverse Spell I ,  except a successfully re -versed spell rebounds with an OB equal to half of the original OB.

17. Spell Bending V * - As Spell Bending I , except attack roll is modi -fied by five times the amount of RR failure.

18.  Spell  Hold X * - As Spell  Hold I ,  except  attack  spell  is  held  10 rounds.

19. Spell Transfer * - By using this spell, the caster can transfer the maintenance and control of one spell with a duration of Concentration (C) to a target. The target must then concentrate to maintain the spell (while the original caster is now free of this requirement) and controls any aspects of the spell effects subject to change. Target must have better than animal intelligence (i.e., no Mindless or Animalistic flaw).

20. Lord Spell Hold * - As Spell Hold I , except attack spell is held for 20 rounds.

25. Spell Bending True * - As Spell Bending I , except spell can be total -ly deflected up to 90° in any direction. Caster of this spell may chose to designate another target for the 'bent' spell - use half of the original OB.

30. Spell Hold True * - As Spell Hold I , except attack spell is held up to 1 round/level.

35. Complex Spell Store - As Spell Store , except any number of spells may be stored up to a total number of spell levels equal to the caster's level. When the stored spell complex is released, all the spells are cast as one instantaneous spell. Each of the component spells may be indi -vidually targeted, although only one may have a Directed Spell bonus added to the attack. Spell failure is rolled on the Force spell column, with triple the number of spells added to the spell failure roll (i.e., spell failure when casting five spells in a complex would result in a +15 to the spell failure roll). The PP cost of this spell is equal to the total PP cost of the spells stored plus ten (with a minimum cost of 35).

40.  Spell  Store True - As Complex Spell Store ,  except  any  or  all  of the stored spells may be cast by someone (or something) other than the caster storing the spell complex. The PP cost of this spell is equal to the total PP cost of the spells stored plus ten plus the number of stored spells cast by someone else (with a minimum cost of 40).

50.  Reversal True * - As Reverse Spell  I ,  except  all  spells  within  a 100'R of the caster are reversed.

Note : The task required by a Quest may be extremely difficult, but it must at least appear to be possible. A Quest must be removed as a curse or mental illness; see Section 10.2 for details.

See section 10.21 for a discussion of spells with 'Kind' in their name.

  

1. Sleep III - Causes target(s) to fall into a natural sleep; the total number of levels that can be affected is 3 (e.g., 3 of level 1; 1 of level 2 and 1 of level 1; 1 of level 3.). All targets must be in cast -er's field of vision. Caster should assign target priority, i.e., which is the 1st potential target, the 2nd, etc. The first round of sleep is magical (the target cannot be awakened through normal means). Falling  asleep  is  rapid,  but  not  so  instantaneous  that  the  victim cannot slump gently to the ground (no injuries under normal cir -cumstances from falling to the ground).
2. Charm Kind - Humanoid target believes the caster is a good friend.
3. Sleep V - As Sleep III , except a total of five levels can be af -fected.
4. Confusion - Target is incapable of making decisions or initiat -ing action, but may continue to fight current foes or in self-defense. The target may also follow orders from the target's leader (if any), but  will  only  be  able  to  follow  them  so  long  as  no  ambiguities arise.
5.  Suggestion - Target will perform a single suggested act that is  not  self-destructive  or  diametrically  opposed  to  the  target's personality (e.g., no suicide suggestions, no blinding himself sug -gestions, no suggestions that a priest pray to an enemy god, etc.).
6. Sleep X - As Sleep III , except a total of 10 levels may be af -fected.
7. Hold Kind - Humanoid target has its Action Points per round reduced by 3 (i.e., normally, the target will have 1 AP each round).
8.  Master  of  Kind -  Humanoid target  must  obey  the  caster  as specified in Suggestion .
9. Lord Sleep - As Sleep III , except a total of 20 levels may be affected.
10. True Charm - As Charm Kind , except any sentient creature may be affected.
11. Quest - Target is given one task; failure results in a penalty determined by the Gamemaster (task must be within capabilities of target). If the target ignores the quest, this incurs the same ef -fects as for failure.
12. Word of Stunning * - [RR Mod.: -10] Target is stunned (-50) for 1 round/10 failure.
13. Word of Pain * - [RR Mod.: -10] Target takes 50% of remain -ing concussion hits upon failure.
14. Hold - As Hold Kind ,  except  any sentient being can be af -fected.
15. Word of Sleep * - [RR Mod.: -10] Target falls into a natural sleep as Sleep III , but there is no level limit.
16. Word of Discord * - [RR Mod.: -10] Target will not cooperate or agree with anyone for 1 day/10 failure.
17. Word of Calling * - [RR Mod.: -10] Target is forced to come and face the caster (fighting if necessary) and then remain immo -bile for 1 rnd/10 failure. Caster must remain immobile, or control lapses.
18. Waiting Word * - [RR Mod.: -10] Any of the 'Words' above can be set to go off at a specified time or if there is movement with -in a designated 10' radius. Listed duration is maximum wait time. Duration  of  effect  on  eventual  target  is  normal  for  the  selected 'Word'. The target of the Word is the individual whose movement triggered it, or the closest target in the case of a specified time.
19. Word of Death * - [RR Mod.: -10] Target suffers the results of an E critical strike on the table of the caster's choice.
20. True Quest - As Quest , except the target is punished for fail -ure (or refusal) by suffering 5 randomly selected E criticals.
25. Phrase * - [RR Mod.: -10] Any three different 'Words' are cast on one target in the same round (a separate RR roll must be made for each one).
30. Mass Word * - [RR Mod.: -10] Any 'Word' may be used and it will affect a number of levels equal to the level of the caster (assign target priority as described in Sleep III ).
35. Master of All - As Master of Kind , except any sentient being can be affected.
40. Waiting Phrase * - [RR Mod.: -10] As Waiting Word , except instead of a 'Word' spell, the effect is as the Phrase spell.
50. Spirit Mastery - Caster can use one spell/round on this list (10th level or lower) with range improved to 100' where the orig -inal range is less.

Note : Area of Effect and Duration are treated unusually and there are other special rules for this list. See Section 10.1.

An 'aggressive' action is defined as any action with the intent to directly harm any individual(s). Actions that result in harm indi -rectly to individuals are not 'aggressive'. Pulling the lever on the wall to drop an individual into a pit is an aggressive action (the action directly resulted in the harm). Running away to get help is not an aggressive action.

  

1. Safety Song - Targets will not take aggressive (offensive) ac -tion towards the caster.
2. Calming Song - Targets are calmed and cannot take aggressive (offensive) action during the performance. This spell also soothes pain and can offset up to -10 in penalties due to injury (until the spell ends).
3. Dancing Song - Targets must dance (to the best of their abili -ty). This requires Concentration and the dancers cannot choose to leave the area of effect unless a second RR is made. All dance-re -lated maneuvers by the targets have a +25 bonus.
4. Stunning Song - Targets are stunned (-50) while song lasts.
5.  Luring  Song -  As Calming  Song ,  except  targets  are  only non-aggressive with respect to the caster and targets will be drawn to  the  caster. They will approach the caster as close as possible without touching the caster or having to fight for position, and they will follow the caster if he is moving.
6. Lullaby - Targets fall into a light sleep. Targets get another RR if someone attempts to wake them while this spell is still active. When the duration is up, the target can be awakened normally.
7. Charming Song - Targets regard the caster as a good friend.
8. Fear's Song - Targets must make an RR versus Essence magic, but the results are treated as an RR versus Fear (see RMCL Section 14.3). Normal modifications against Fear do not apply.
9. Seduction's Song - Targets become emotionally open and re -gard the caster favorably. This adds +10 to any maneuver made to seduce a target of this spell by someone other than the caster and adds +10 to any Influence skill maneuver or +30 to any seduction attempt made by the caster to affect a target of this spell.
10. Greater Calming Song - As Calming Song , except for area of effect, and it can offset up to -20 in injury-related penalties.
11. Dancing Song True - As Dancing Song ,  except for area of effect.
12. Haunting Lullaby - As Lullaby , except targets experience a sleep troubled by nightmares. For 24 hours after awakening, they will have a -40 penalty to any RR against fear or fear-inducing magic.
13. Panic's Song - [RR Mod.: -25] As Fear's Song , except targets suffer a -25 modification to their RRs.
14. Stunning Song True - As Stunning Song , except for area of effect.
15. Luring Song True - As Luring Song , except for area of effect.
16. Fight Song - Targets will attack nearest individual other than the  caster.  If  two  or  more  individuals  are  equidistant,  the  target will attack the one he would normally be most inclined to fight. If a target injures (inflicts a critical on) a loved one, a close friend, or a longtime comrade in arms, he may make a new RR.
17. Lullaby True - As Lullaby , except for area of effect.
18. Charming Song True - As Charming Song , except for area of effect.
19. Terror's Song - [RR Mod.: -25] As Panic's Song , except for area of effect.
20.  Song  of  Command -  Targets  will  obey  the  caster's  com -mands, unless the action commanded is totally alien to the target's nature (e.g., no suicidal or self-mutilating commands unless the target is already self-destructive). If a target cannot understand the command, it will simply take no action.
25. Panic's Song True - [RR Mod: -50] As Panic's Song , except for area of effect and RR modifier.
30. Calming Song True - [RR Mod: -10] As Calming Song , ex -cept  for  area  of  effect,  RR  modifier,  and  a  maximum  of  -30  in offset penalties.
35. Seduction's Song True - [RR Mod: -10] As Seduction's Song , except for area of effect, RR modifier, and the caster's bonuses are +50 to seduction attempts and +25 to other Influence maneuvers, while those other than the caster gain a +25 to seduction attempts where the object of the seduction is under the influence of this spell.
40. Song of Command True - [RR Mod: -10] As Song of Command , except for area of effect and RR modifier.
50. Fight Song True - [RR Mod: -10] As Fight Song , except for area of effect and RR modifier.

Note :  Spells  that  involve  teleportation  are  normally  quite  noisy and difficult to silence. Air is being pushed about in a manner not unlike a thunderclap. Amount of noise depends on the size of the object teleported. The spells on this list will muffle the sound and give it a 'theatrical' tone. but it will be clearly audible.

  

1. Spotlight * - Caster is lit by a bright circle of light (between 5' and 10' diameter as desired). At the time of casting, the caster designates his 'front' and the light will shine from that direction. The caster can change his 'front' by concentrating (the light will blink  off  and  another  will  blink  on). The  diameter  and  color  of the light can also be changed and the light dimmed down to a soft mood light. All adjustable features can be changed at once.
2.  Dim Lights * - All non-magical light sources in the area of effect are dimmed to the luminosity of soft candle light.
3. Lightshow * - Caster can create colored lights that will shine in the area of effect. The caster can change the colors and forms of the light by concentrating. The light can take any form the caster desires, but the light will not illuminate more than the area of ef -fect. For example, several small spheres of various colors can float around the caster's feet, or five red beams can flash back and forth across the caster's body.
4. Showman I - Caster receives a +5 bonus to all Performance Art maneuvers for the duration of this spell.
5. Legerdemain - Caster can make any one target (up to 1 pound per level of the caster) vanish. The caster must designate a loca -tion for the target to 'reappear' in (the location must be within the caster's line of sight and within 100' per level of the caster). The object is teleported to the designated location at the time of casting, where it may remain invisibly until the duration expires or the caster chooses for it to appear. When the item is teleported, it makes a sound only where it disappears.

6. Enthrall I - The target of this spell is enthralled with the caster (for as long as the caster is performing or for the duration of this spell,  whichever is shorter). While enthralled, the target is con -sidered to be Concentrating on the performance and has a -75 to Perception regarding anything else. Enthrallment is broken if the target is attacked.

7. Hidden Pocket - The caster can place any one inanimate object (up to 1 pound per level of the caster) into any available container. The container opening must be large enough to fit at least one dimension of the object. When the container is examined, it will appear  empty  to  all  normal  perception  (including  feeling).  The caster may pluck the item from the container at any time (up to the duration of the spell). If the object is not taken from the container before duration is up, the object appears in the container as if it were there all along.

8. Pratfall * - When the caster has experienced a fumble/failure result with an attack or physical maneuver, this spell allows the caster to turn tragedy into comedy. The caster suffers no negative effects beyond losing the opportunity to act as desired; the caster's antics also bolster allied morale and the next friendly morale/fear RR made in the current situation receives a +20 bonus.

9. Showman II - As Showman I , except bonus is +10.

10. Quick Study - Caster can read at three times the normal rate; this material is retained unusually well, granting a +10 bonus to any attempt to recall the information later.
11. Enthrall V - As Enthrall I , except affects up to five targets.
12. Volunteer from the Audience - Target will perform any ac -tions that the caster dictates for the duration of this spell. If the target of this spell has previously been a 'volunteer' for the caster, he suffers an RR modification of -1 for each previous time he was a successful target. If an action is commanded which is completely alien to the target, the target receives a new RR with a +50 bonus.
13.  Lovely Assistant -  Target  of  this  spell  (which  may  be  the caster) gains an enhanced appearance. This spell enhances facial appearance, body appearance, and clothing appearance (roughly equivalent  to  a  modern  make-over,  including  fashion).  Target gains a +10 to all rolls where personal appearance is a factor or +20 if appearance is a major factor.
14. Showman III - As Showman I , except bonus is +15.
15. Enthrall X - As Enthrall I , except affects up to ten targets.
16. Disappear - As Legerdemain , except affects any target up to the caster's own mass.
17. Master of Ceremonies I - As Showman I , except bonus ap -plies to a number of target up the caster's level.
18. Showman IV - As Showman I , except bonus is +20.
19. Quick Study True - As Quick Study , except caster can read a page at a glance (i.e., caster can read as fast as he can turn through the pages).
20.  Mass Enthrall - As Enthrall I ,  except  affects  a  number  of targets up to the caster's level.
25. Showman V - As Showman I , except bonus is +25.
30. Disappear True - As Disappear , except may affect any one living creature or inanimate object up to 100 pounds per level of the caster.
35. Master of Ceremonies II - As Master of Ceremonies I , except bonus is +10.
40. Showman VIII - As Showman I , except bonus is +40.
50. Master of Ceremonies IV - As Master of Ceremonies I , ex -cept bonus is +20.

Note : Area of Effect and Duration are treated unusually. See Section 10.1.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Harmonize - Target becomes an 'Ally' for purposes of this list. The caster is always considered an Ally for purposes of this list. The caster is limited to a number of Allies (other than the caster) equal to his ranks in this list, but may remove any one individual from the status of Ally with a round of concen -tration at any time.
2. Song of Vigor - All Allies make Endurance rolls with a +50 bonus.
3. Song of Coordination - When Allies are working together on some shared task, this spell provides a bonus to that task equal to +3 per number of Allies involved (includes the caster, although the caster obviously cannot be providing 'hands on' help).
4. Battle Hymn I - Allies gain a +10 bonus to all RRs against fear or magic that produces fear or calm. They also gain +4 OB.
5. Song of Sharing I * - This spell casts another spell known to the caster, but changes the nature of that spell. The spell to be shared must have '1 target' or a larger number of targets as its normal area of effect. The Song of Sharing I will cause the shared spell to affect all Allies within a 5'R as if the shared spell had been directly cast on each of them. The PP cost of casting is the cost of this spell (5 PP) plus the cost of the spell to be shared. For example, if a Bard knew the spell Leaping from the Lofty Bridge list, every Ally within 5' could be given the ability to Leap by casting Song of Sharing I and expending 6 PP (5 for the base cost of Song of Sharing I and 1 PP for the Leaping spell effect). If the spell to be shared is of higher level than the Song of Sharing , the shared spell's level is used for determining the difficulty of spell-casting. Spell effects end

when either the duration of the Song of Sharing ends or when the normal duration of the spell shared ends (i.e., the Leaping effect would only last one round).

6. Countersong I - Caster creates a defensive song that will protect anyone (not just Allies) from sound-based attacks (including the spells on Controlling Songs). Any such attack must make a successful RR against the caster's level or fail within the bounds of the Countersong.
7. Song of Remembrance - All Allies gain a +20 bonus to all Lore skill maneuvers and any other memory-based tasks.
8. Song of Unity - All Allies within area of effect are telepath -ically linked. They may communicate mentally with each other freely. Essentially this is silent, largely secure communication.
9. Battle Hymn II - As Battle Hymn I , except the RR bonus is +20 and the OB bonus is +8.
10. Song of Sharing II * - As Song of Sharing I , except for radius of effect.
11. Song of Magic - Allies may add the caster's level to their spell-casting maneuver rolls.
12. Countersong II - As Countersong I , except radius is 20'.
13. Battle Hymn III - As Battle Hymn I , except the RR bonus is +30 and the OB bonus is +12.
14. Song of Clarity - Allies reduce all stun rounds taken by 1 and gain a +30 bonus to RRs against spells which cause con -fusion.
15. Song of Sharing III * - As Song of Sharing I , except for radius of effect.
16. Song of Renewal - Allies recover 2 concussion hits per round.
17. Countersong III - As Countersong I , except radius is 30'.
18. Battle Hymn IV - As Battle Hymn I , except the RR bonus is +40 and the OB bonus is +16.
19. Song of Wrath - Allies gain +10 OB and do double hits and an additional Impact critical (one severity level less than the primary critical) in melee combat.
20. Song of Sharing IV * - As Song of Sharing I , except for radius of effect.
25. Battle Hymn True - As Battle Hymn I , except the RR bo -nus is twice the caster's level and the OB bonus is +20.
30. Song of Sharing V * - As Song of Sharing I , except for radius of effect.
35. Countersong V - As Countersong I , except radius is 50'.
40. Song of Sharing True * - As Song of Sharing I , except that radius is equal to the caster's level in feet.
50. Countersong X - As Countersong I , except radius is 100'.

  

1. Instrumental Analysis - Caster can assess the value of a musi -cal instrument to within 10% of its actual value. This spell allows the caster to calculate different values for the different cultures he is familiar with based on the general value of the instrument, the raw materials used to make it, and the quality of craftsmanship and sound. Additional value (e.g., from being made by a famous mak -er) is not revealed. The caster also gains a general knowledge of the instrument's origins (the culture of origin and the instrument's age within 10% of its actual age). Finally, he understands how the instrument is to be played, although actually playing competent -ly requires the development of skill with the instrument through practice.
2. Assessing Eye - The caster has a +50 bonus to any attempt to appraise the market value of the target item. Item may be appraised for any culture/location of which the caster has knowledge.

3. Detect Power - Detects magical power in an item, but not the realm or how much. A different item can be examined each round by concentrating.

4.  Emblem  Recognition -  The  caster  can  examine  any  visual symbol of an individual or group, be it a company logo, shield design, tattoo, flag, or other device. The caster learns the name of the individual or group so represented, a rough idea of the nature and (usual) location of that which is represented (e.g., 'a knight of  Glakony'  or  'a  criminal  gang  in  the  southern  islands'),  and the purpose of the emblem (e.g., 'to mark his works', 'to identify church grounds, property, or servants', or 'battlefield identifica -tion').
5. Rune Literacy III - Any Runes maneuver made by the caster has a +15 bonus.
6. Item Origins - The caster learns the area of origin of the item, the race of the being who made it, and when it was made (within 100 years). If the creator gave the item a name, that is also re -vealed.
7. Attuning III - Any Attunement maneuver made by the caster has a +15 bonus.
8. Power's Tale - The caster learns the primary power of a mag -ical  item.  This  knowledge  comes  in  the  form  a  short  narrative illustrating this power or an explanatory bit of verse.

9. Item's Tale - The caster learns a narrative account of the most significant event in the item's recent past. The event cannot have occurred more than one hour per level of the caster in the past.

10. The Crafter's Tale - The caster learns who made the item and when. He also learns of any craftsmanship bonus the item possesses. He learns whom the item was made for, if it was crafted for a specific person or group, and he learns for what purpose the item was made.
11. Detect Cursed Item - The caster learns if there is a curse on the item.

12. Rune Literacy VII - As Rune Literacy III , but bonus is +35.

13. Find Significance - The caster learns the cultural and histor -ical significance of one item. He also learns its personal signifi -cance, if any, to its current owner. This knowledge comes in the form of an illustrative narrative.

14. Attuning VII - As Attuning III , but bonus is +35.

15. Item Analysis - The caster gains complete information on the item's construction, purpose, magical abilities, and any non-mag -ical bonuses.

16. The Reaper's Tale - The caster receives a narrative account of how someone died. Since this is not a vision, the caster has only a description of the killer (and perhaps the name, if it is revealed in dialog), but vision-centric defenses against retrosurveillance will not stymie this spell. When this spell is cast, the caster must be touching an object that had significance in the death (i.e., the mur -der weapon, the body, etc.) The narrative will be 'from the point of view' of the object in question, so casting on multiple objects may provide a more complete account of events.

17. Item's Epic - As Item's Tale , except without a time limit.
18. Rune Literacy X - As Rune Literacy II , but bonus is +50.
19. Distance Learning * - The next touch-ranged spell on this list cast by the caster of this spell will have its range improved to 20'.

20. Attuning X - As Attuning III , but bonus is +50.

25. Item's Saga - As Item's Tale , except caster learns the whole history of the item. This does not include every detail, but does include all significant events.
30. The Alchemist's Tale - As Item Analysis and Item Origins combined, except that the Bard may study one item each round during the duration of the spell.
35. Rune Literacy XV - As Rune Literacy III , but bonus is +75.
40. Looter's Eye * - Caster immediately knows the location of the most valuable (financially) object within the area of effect.

50. Attuning XV - As Attuning III , but bonus is +75.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Quiet I - Creates a 1'R area into and out of which sound can -not travel. As discussed in Section 10.17, this spell can be cast on an individual target, which the spell will then follow; this target gains  +25  to  Stalking  attempts,  but  likewise  automatically  fails any  Perception  attempts  based  on  hearing  alone  and  suffers  a -50 to Perception rolls where hearing is a factor (e.g., to detect someone  Stalking  the  target).  Note  that  this  does  not  interfere with spell-casting (the target can still speak, even yell, the sound is simply unable to leave the radius of the Quiet -  certain spells like Ultrasonics may have their range limited to the interior of the Quiet radius, however).

2. Sonic Law I - Caster may manipulate sound within the area of effect, creating any single sound desired. This sound may be heard outside the area of effect, if the caster wishes. Sound cannot be damaging.

3.  Hush -  For  the  duration  of  this  spell,  all  sounds  in  the  area of effect are no louder than a whisper. The caster is immune to the effects of this spell. In addition, the caster can designate up to one extra target per level to be immune to the effects of the spell. By concentrating for one round, the caster may make one target immune to the effect or remove one target's immunity.

4. Fanfare - A fanfare of music plays. The caster may designate one instrument (that will make the sounds of the fanfare) for every five levels of experience (or portion thereof). The volume of the fanfare cannot exceed that which would be normally made by the designated instrument(s).

5. Sphere of Silence I - As Quiet I , except radius is 10'.
6. Sonic Law II - As Sonic Law I , except radius is 10'.
7. Sudden Sound - Causes a very loud, sudden sound next to the target's ears; target is stunned (-50) for 1 round per 10 failure.

8.  Deafen - Target  cannot  hear  sounds  occurring  more  than  6" from the target's ears.

9.  Cracks -  Certain  sound  waves  cause  any  cracks  or  flaws  in solid, inanimate material (up to 1,000 cu') to expand to their limit.

10. Music - Caster may designate any music to be played as if the caster were playing it (and the caster must actually have played the music at least once). The music will play continuously for the du -ration of the spell. If the musical score finishes before the duration is over, the music will repeat as many times as needed. The caster can designate singing instead of an instrument.

11. Sphere of Silence V - As Sphere of Silence I ,  except radius is 50'.

12. Sonic Law III - As Sonic Law I , except radius is 100'.

13.  Shatter  Blast -  Causes  a  nonmetal,  rigid,  inanimate  object to shatter (up to 1 cubic foot in size). All within a 5'R take an A Impact critical, anyone holding the object takes a C critical.

14. Waiting Sound - A set series of sounds can be concentrated upon and then delayed up to 24 hours or until triggered by a spec -ified sound. The sounds to be delayed may last up to 1 minute per level.

15. Orchestra - As Music ,  except caster may designate one in -strument per five levels of experience (or portion thereof) that will play simultaneously. All instruments (including vocals) will play as if the caster were playing them.

16. Sonic Law IV - As Sonic Law I , except radius is 10' per level of the caster.

17. Long Sudden Sound - As Sudden Sound , except for range.

18.  Minor  Ultrasonics - All  beings  (except  the  caster)  within range  capable  of  hearing  ultrasonic  sounds  are  stunned  (-50)  1 rnd/10 failure; an RR must be made once per round while in the radius. Even if they are not stunned, animals capable of hearing ultrasonics will have to make a second, non-magical RR against Fear (level of Fear is half the caster's level).

19. Sonic Splendor - First, this spell will clean and tune an instru -ment instantly; this effect is 'permanent'. This spell cannot repair actually broken or missing parts; if new strings are supplied, it can use them to replace broken ones, for example. Second, the sound quality of the instrument is improved to the equivalent of a +10 quality instrument if it was below that value. Third, if the caster spends a round in concentration, the instrument can be made to sound like any other instrument with which the caster is familiar.

20.  Crumbling -  As Cracks ,  except  material  with  cracks  will crumble to dust.

25. Sphere of Silence X - As Sphere of Silence I , except radius is 100'.

30. Minor Ultrasonics True - As Minor Ultrasonics , except for radius.

35. Killing Sound - Caster launches a concentrated burst of sound at the target, doing a D Impact critical.

40. Mass Sudden Sound - As Sudden Sound , except affects up to one target per caster level.

50. Sonic Law True - As Sonic Law I , except parameters are as listed and sounds can be programmed, the sounds may be delayed (up to 24 hr), there can be more than one sound at a time, and sounds are instantly changeable.

For options b through e, they trigger the Repeat Performance if they occur/exist in the area affected by the Controlling Song. For those options, the response to the trigger may occur instantly or there may be a set delay in order, e.g., to let more orcs enter the area of effect before the spell goes off.

Note : Illusions are one of the more complex and subtle types of magic and they are explained at length in Section 10.10.

For more information on invisibility, see Section 10.11.

  

1.  Shadow - Caster  and  objects  on  the  caster's  person appear  to  be  in  shadow  and  thus  are  almost  invisible  in dark areas (in many situations this could be handled with a Stalking bonus of between +25 and +75).
2. Unseen III - Up to three objects are made invisible (1 garment, 1 naked body, etc.); until 24 hrs pass or the object is struck by a violent blow (being hit by a weapon, falling, etc.) or the object makes a violent move (i.e., an attack) or casts a spell of type E or F.
3. Conceal I - Target inanimate object takes on the visual appearance  of  a  similar  object.  For  example,  a  small  red key may appear as a small blue spoon. The object cannot vary in dimensions by more than 100% of actual size in any given dimension. This is strictly a visual illusion (and can be detected as such).
4. Invisibility I - As Unseen III , except it covers one tar -get and everything within 1' of the target.
5.  Conceal  III - As Conceal  I ,  except  the  caster  may choose two options - affect one additional object, double the duration, increase the range to 50' for one object, or add a tactile sense to one concealed object.
6. Invisibility II - As Invisibility I , except the caster can vary  the  radius  up  to  1'.  This  makes  the  invisible  target harder to see by reducing the 'fringe effect.'
7. Unseen Blow - One melee attack (armed or unarmed) is covered by a moment of invisibility. Unless the target of that attack has the power to see the invisible, the target's parry is subject to a -100 penalty (down to a minimum of 0 parry DB).
8.  Displacement I - Caster's apparent location is offset from  the  actual  location;  all  attacks  have  no  effect  10% of the time. Each time a foe misses due to this effect, the chance of that foe missing again goes down 5%.
9. Conceal V - As Conceal III
10. Unseen X - As Unseen III
11. , except choose four options. , except up to 10 objects.
11. Displacement II - As Displacement I , except chance of missing is 20%.
12. Invisibility Sphere II - As Invisibility II , except cast -er can vary the radius up to 10', determined at the time of casting.
13. Hide Thoughts - Caster becomes almost impossible to read as to honesty or emotions (-100 to all attempts to use Social Awareness skill on the caster) and spells to read the caster's mind or emotional state must make an RR roll against this spell or simply fail.
14.  See  Invisible - Caster can see invisible things any -where the caster can normally see; the caster's attacks on invisible targets get no penalty (as they are not invisible to him).
15. Displacement III - As Displacement I , except chance of missing is 30%.
16. Invisibility Sphere III - As Invisibility Sphere II , ex -cept caster can vary the radius by up to 20'.
17. Unseen Weapon - As Unseen Blow , except affects all melee attacks by the target during the spell's duration.
18. Hide Thoughts True - As Hide Thought s, except for duration.
19. See Invisible True - As See Invisible , except the dura -tion is 10 minutes per level.
20. Lord Conceal - As Conceal III , except choose nine -teen options.
25. Mass Unseen - As Unseen III , except up to 1 object per level.
30. Mass Invisibility - As Invisibility I ,  except as many targets as the caster's level may be the centers of constant 1' radii of invisibility.
35. Displacement V - As Displacement I , except chance of missing is 50%.
40.  Conceal True - As Conceal III ,  except  choose  one option per caster level.
50. True Invisibility - As Invisibility I , except the caster can vary the radius of invisibility up to 1' and if the caster attacks he is only visible for the 5 seconds immediately fol -lowing the attack. Likewise, he may cast a type E or F spell and  become  visible  for  the  following  5  seconds.  Violent blows do not affect this spell.

1. Deepen Sleep * - [RR Mod.: -30] Target that is already at least napping falls into a very deep sleep, taking a -50 penalty to Per -ception rolls to wake up.

2. Charm Animals - Target animal(s) will believe the caster is a good friend.
3. Caginess I * - Caster gains a +10 bonus to all Social Awareness skill maneuvers.
4. Voice of Sincerity - Anyone making a Social Awareness maneuver with respect to the caster becomes a target of this spell. If affected, the target will suffer a -25 penalty to all such Social Awareness maneuvers while the spell lasts.
5. Silver Tongue I - Caster gains a +10 bonus to all Influence skill maneuvers.
6. Mind Reading I - Caster can read the surface thoughts of the target.
7. Caginess II * - Caster gains a +20 bonus to all Social Aware -ness skill maneuvers.
8. Charm Group - One humanoid target for every five levels (or fraction thereof) of the caster will believe the caster is a very good friend.
9. Voice of Eloquence - Caster becomes highly fluent (equivalent of rank 10) in any spoken or signed language in which he has at least one rank.
10. Caginess III * - Caster gains a +30 bonus to all Social Aware -ness skill maneuvers.

11. Group Suggestion - Humanoid targets (up to one for every five levels, or fraction thereof, of the caster) will perform a single suggested act that is not self-destructive or diametrically opposed to a target's personality (e.g., no suicide suggestions, no self-mu -tilation suggestions, no suggestions that a priest pray to an enemy god, etc.). Suggestion must be the same for all targets.

12. Silver Tongue II - Caster gains a +20 bonus to all Influence skill maneuvers.

13. Hold Group - Humanoid targets have their Action Points per round reduced by 3 (i.e., normally, the targets will have 1 AP each round). Up to one target for every five levels (or fraction thereof) of the caster may be affected.

14. Voice of Magnificence - Caster has a +25 bonus to any Perfor -mance Art skill maneuver using his voice.

15. Mind Reading II - As Mind Reading I , except for range.

16. Caginess IV * - Caster gains a +40 bonus to all Social Aware -ness skill maneuvers.

17. Silver Tongue III - Caster gains a +30 bonus to all Influence skill maneuvers.

18. Master Group - As Group Suggestion , except group will obey throughout duration and different commands can be issued to dif -ferent members of the group.

19. Calligraphy of Suggestion - The caster must record in writing a single suggested act that is not self-destructive or diametrically opposed to the ultimate target's personality (e.g., no suicide sug -gestions, no blinding himself suggestions, no suggestions that a priest  pray  to  an  enemy  god,  etc.).  This  creates  a  minor  magic item, and at this time no RR is made. When the text is read by the intended recipient (caster may specify an individual, a specific type, or simply aim for the first reader), the spell is triggered and if the triggering reader fails his RR, he will act as suggested. Once triggered, the text loses its enchantment.

20. Caginess V * - Caster gains a +50 bonus to all Social Aware -ness skill maneuvers.

25. Mind Reading True - As Mind Reading I , except for range.

30. Mystic Papers - [RR: -25] The caster presents any paper or badgelike item or whatever item is roughly similar in type to the proper identification, credential, pass, or other document granting permission  and/or  authority  that  is  being  claimed  by  the  caster. If the spell succeeds, the targets perceive the object presented as the genuine article. Caster must initially touch the item, but then the item may be taken for inspection and even handed from one individual to another out of sight of the caster without interruption of the effect.

35. Silver Tongue V - Caster gains a +50 bonus to all Influence skill maneuvers.

40. Mass Suggestion - [RR Mod.: -10] Humanoid targets (up to one per level  of  the  caster)  will  perform  a  single  suggested  act that is not self-destructive or diametrically opposed to a target's personality (e.g., no suicide suggestions, no self-mutilation sug -gestions, no suggestions that a priest pray to an enemy god, etc.). Suggestion must be the same for all targets.

50. Group Quest - Targets are given one task; failure results in a  penalty  determined  by  the  Gamemaster  (task  must  be  within capabilities of the targets). If a target ignores the quest, or fails to cooperate with the other targets towards the success of the quest, this incurs the same effects as for failure.

Note : See Section 10.15 for restrictions on encumbrance re -lating to movement spells.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Jog * - Caster may move at two times normal walking pace (i.e., Jog pace) as easily as walking. Fatigue and difficulty of maneuvers are as if at Walk pace; spells requiring a 'walking pace' may be used (e.g. Shadow Steps ), but not those requir -ing slower than walking pace (e.g., Spider's Step ). Once the caster stops moving, the spell is canceled.
2.  Longjump * - Caster may jump (from any pace) up to 10' plus 5' per level of the caster horizontally or 5' plus 2' per level of the caster vertically. This spell will allow the caster to always land safely from jumps of this distance or less. The jump itself is a 1 AP action or it may be incorporated into movement at no cost if the caster is moving at a Jog (x2) or greater pace.
3. Soft Landing * - This spell may be cast when the caster begins to fall, taking effect immediately, allowing the caster to land safely in a fall up to 20' per level of the caster and to take that distance off the severity of any longer fall. This landing will also be noiseless.
4. Shadow Steps - Allows the caster to cloak all of his move -ments  in  complete  silence,  so  long  as  he  moves  no  faster than a walking pace. This provides a +25 bonus to Stalking maneuvers  and  negates  any  penalties  for  especially  noisy surfaces.
5. Underwater Movement - Caster can take action underwater as if on land.
6. Balancing * - Adds +50 to any rolls for any moving ma -neuvers performed at a walking pace or less (e.g., walking a 3" beam).
7.  Spider's Step - Caster can move (at Creep pace) along any solid surface angled up to 90° so long as at least three point contact (e.g., two feet and a hand) is maintained with the surface.
8. Long Dive * - Caster can safely dive through the air up to 50' per level so long as there is deep enough water present at the end of the dive (at least 1' of water per 25' of dive).
9. Traceless Passing * - Caster can move at a walking pace without leaving tracks or other visible signs of his passing.
10. Spider's Step True - As Spider's Step , except caster can move along any surface (including ceilings).
11. Float * - Caster can float upon the air. While floating, the caster is at the mercy of the prevailing winds and cannot control any aspect of his flight without access to some other motive force (i.e., pulling along a rope or wall, being towed, etc.).
12.  Spider's  Walk - As Spider's  Step ,  except  caster  may move at a normal walking pace and he needs only to maintain a 2-point contact with the wall.
13. Run * - As Jog , except pace is three times walking pace.
14. Shadow Landing * - As Soft Landing , except caster can land safely from any fall 99% of the time, and still takes the normal 20'/level off any fall for the 1% of the time that safety is not complete. While falling, the caster gets his full Stalking bonus and adds +25 to that if not in direct sunlight.
15. Glide I - Caster can 'glide' through the air. The product of caster's altitude and horizontal speed cannot exceed 100 (with altitude in feet and speed in feet per round). For ex -ample, a caster can glide along at a rate of 5' per round if he were 20' off the ground, or he could glide at the rate of 50' per round if he were 2' off the ground. Note that the product must equal 100 (i.e., the caster cannot choose to have a result less than or more than 100). Elevation may be increased up to 5' or decreased up to 10' each round, with the highest elevation being used to calculate the horizontal speed. There is a mini -mum elevation of 2'.
16. Airwalking - Caster can walk on calm air. This spell only allows for horizontal movement. Vertical movement must be achieved by other means.
17.  Secret  Speed  * -  Caster  can  move  at  any  pace  or  using  any  means (e.g.,  swimming, which would normally be less stealthy due to splashing water) without penalty to any Stalking rolls.

1.  Sly  Ears -  Caster  gains  an  extremely  acute  sense  of hearing. This  results  in  +50  to  Perception  rolls  involving only hearing, +25 to Perception involving hearing and other senses.
2. Nightvision - Caster can see up to 100' as if it were day -light, so long as there is some light.
3. Scent - Caster gains an extremely acute sense of smell. This results in +50 to Perception rolls involving only smell, +25 to Perception involving smell and other senses.
4. Sensory Marker - One location is 'marked' so that the caster  can  find  it  again  later  with  a Far Sense spell.  The marker is automatically located when the caster casts a Far Sense spell if the marker is within range of the Far Sense spell. A marker can be placed on any inanimate object. The caster can only have as many markers as he has ranks in this list; a Sensory Marker spell can be cancelled even if the caster is no longer within range of the marker.
5. Far Sense I - Caster may designate any one of his senses to be used at any 'marked' location within range (see Sensory Marker ). The caster can use any perception abilities he has at the time (e.g., if he is currently under the effects of Nightvision ,  he  will  have Nightvision at  the  marked loca -tion). The remote sensory point may be rotated to face any direction. While he is sensing at the marked location, the caster must remain immobile and concentrate (and does not have that sense available at his own location).
6. Sidevision - Caster has a 300° field of vision. The flank bonus for attacks against the caster is lowered to +5 and the rear bonus is lowered to +15.
7.  Touch -  Caster  gains  extreme  tactile  sensitivity.  This provides a bonus to any action requiring a sense of touch. For  example,  caster  might  receive  +25  to  picking  locks, disarming traps, opening secret doors, etc. and +50 to Per -ception involving only touch, +25 to Perception involving touch and other senses).
8. Watervision - Caster can see 100' in any water (includ -ing murky water) as if through air in daylight.
9. Darkvision - As Nightvision , except any darkness can be seen through. No light at all is needed for this spell to work.
10. Far Sense II - As Far Sense I , except caster may desig -nate up to two senses for use at the marked location.
11. Woodsight - Caster can see through wood (up to 1" per level).
12. Lightvision - Caster can see in any brightness of light (including that which would be blinding or glaring). This spell does not work in the absence of light.
13. Fabricsight - Caster can see through any woven organ -ic substance (up to 1" per level).
14. Greater Far Sense I - As Far Sense I ,  except caster can move while the spell is active (though he must maintain concentration).
15. Long Far Sense I - As Far Sense I , except for range.
16. Stonesight - Caster can see through stone (up to 1" per level).
17. Locate Marker - Caster knows the location (distance and direction) of one chosen Sensory Marker relative to the caster's current location.
18. Greater Far Sense II - As Far Sense II , except caster can move while the spell is active (though he must maintain concentration).
19.  Metalsight -  Caster  can  see  through  metal  (up  to  1" per level).
20. Long Far Sense II - As Far Sense II , except for range.
25. Vision Suite - As all Vision spells on this list operating at the same time.
30. Senses True - Caster has the effects of Sly Ears , Scent , Touch , and all Vision spells simultaneously.
35. Danger Sense - Caster has a warning of any impending danger. This will give the caster a second chance to notice any  trap  he  has  missed  before  actually  triggering  it,  pre -vent  any  attacker  from  gaining  the  bonus  for  Surprise  or succeeding  in  using Ambush  skill  against  the  caster,  and should provide similar protection against other sudden dan -ger (GM's discretion).
40. Far Sense True - As Greater Far Sense I , except caster can use all senses and the range is improved.
50. Sense Mastery - Caster may use any lower level spell on this list once per round.

  

1. Reflection - Makes one surface of an inanimate object up to  10'x10' perfectly reflective in the orientation desired by the caster, e.g. to permit viewing around a corner.
2. Smoke Cloud - Creates a cloud of obscuring smoke (caster's choice of color) which obscures as heavy fog (-50 Perception, visibility reduced to 50').
3. Sound/Light Mirage - Creates any simple, immobile visual image/scene in an area of up to 10'R, or creates a set of immobile sounds in an area of up to 10'R.
4. Subtle Eye I - Caster gains a +25 Perception bonus to notice that which is hidden by any means (including noticing illusions).
5.  Illusion  III - Creates a simple, immobile image or scene up to an area of 10'R. Two of the following options may also be chosen: a) an extra sense can be added (not the tactile or Pres -ence senses), b) the duration can be doubled, c) the range can be doubled, d) the radius of the area of effect can be doubled, or e) the illusion can cast light. All parts of the area of effect must be in the caster's field of vision at the time of casting.
6. Darkness - Creates an area of darkness up to 2'R/lvl about the  point  touched. The  darkness  is  equal  to  the  darkest  night. (See RMCL Section 15.7) If the point is on a mobile object or being, it will move with the object/being (but any target gets an RR to avoid having it 'stick' to  them).  One  of  the  following options may also be chosen: a) an extra sense can be added (not the tactile or Presence senses), b) the duration can be doubled, c) the range can be doubled, d) the radius of the area of effect can  be  doubled, e) another  image  can  be  created  and  moved independently of the first  (all  separate  images  must  be  within the caster's field of vision and within range of the spell), f) the phantasm can cast light, or g) limited repetitious sounds, move -ments, etc., can be added that do not require concentration of the caster (the proper senses involved must also be included within the illusion).
7.  Phantasms II - Creates the image of one object or being that will move however the caster wants (as long as the caster concentrates). When the caster stops concentrating, the  image remains but stops moving. The caster may resume concentration again  later,  and  make  the  image  move  again  (presuming  that the duration has not expired). The image can be of any size that would fit in a 10'R.

One of the following options may also be chosen: a) an  extra sense can be added (not the tactile or Presence senses), b) the duration  can  be  doubled, c) the  range  can  be  doubled, d) the radius  of  the  area  of  effect  can  be  doubled, e) another  image can be created and moved independently of the first (all separate images  must  be  within  the  caster's  field  of  vision  and  within range of the spell), f) the phantasm can cast light, or g) limited repetitious sounds, movements, etc., can be added that do not require concentration of the caster (the proper senses involved must also be included within the illusion).

8. Extinguish Minor - Instantly extinguishes a fire up to the size of a campfire.
9.  Waiting  Distraction - The  next  spell  cast  from  this  list (must be within 1 minute) will have its effect delayed up to 24 hours. At the time of casting, the caster must decide upon the trigger for the spell. The caster can choose one of the following: a) time period, b) specified movements, or c) specified sounds.
10. Ignite Fuel - Instantly ignites any one thing intended to burn, e.g. it will light a lantern, torch, firewood, but not other items such as furniture or clothing.
11. Subtle Eye II - As Subtle Eye I , except bonus is +50.
12. Illusion V - As Illusion II , except four options can be cho -sen.
13. Phantasms III - As Phantasms II , except two options may be chosen.
14. Extinguish Major - As Extinguish Minor , except fires up to 10' in diameter.
15. Mass Extinguish Minor - As Extinguish Minor , except all minor fires in the area of effect.
16. Illusion VIII - As Illusion II , except seven options can be chosen.
17. Smoke Cloud True - As Smoke Cloud , but area of effect is 10'/lvl R.
18. Phantasm IV - As Phantasms II, except three options can be chosen.
19. Mass Extinguish True - Immediately extinguishes all fire within 5'/lvl radius.
20. Mass Ignite - As Ignite Fuel , except it will ignite all suit -able things of the specified type (or all suitable types) within the radius.
25. Phantasms V - As Phantasms II , except four options can be chosen.
30. Illusion X - As Illusion II , except nine options can be cho -sen.
35. Subtle Eye IV - As Subtle Eye I , except bonus is +100.
40. Illusions XV - As Illusions II ,  except  14  options can be chosen.
50. Phantasms X - As Phantasms II , except nine options can be chosen.

Note :  For the purposes of this list, a machine is any deliberately constructed device with at least one moving part built to perform a specific function.

  

1. Tradesman's Lore - Caster receives basic idea of item's purpose, and receives +20 to its use if it is intended to be operated using any Craft or Technical skill.
2. Tune - When this spell is cast upon a machine, the machine's efficiency will return to its original level. For example, if cast upon a rusty lock, the lock would return to its original non-rusty oper -ational level.
3. Phantom Tools I - This spell allows the caster to perform one maneuver using a Craft or Technical skill as if the caster had a complete set of the appropriate tools with a bonus of +10.
4. Jam I - Target mechanism (trap, lock, door, machine, etc) is jammed, and has only a 7% chance of operating when used/trig -gered normally. It remains jammed until repaired.
5.  Jewel/Metal  Assessment - Caster  can  assess  the  value  of jewels and metals within 10% of actual value. This spell allows the caster to calculate different values for all of the cultures with which the caster is familiar. This spell evaluates materials only, not craftsmanship or magical properties.
6. Operate I - This spell will operate any non-magical machine in its normal capacity for the duration. After the duration, the ma -chine will operate normally. For example, if this spell were used to turn a wheel, the wheel would spin for the duration of the spell, then  slowly  spin  to  a  stop.  This  merely  provides  basic  motive power;  any  additional  controls  (directional  controls,  frequency settings, etc.) must be handled separately.
7.  Item Assessment - As Jewel/Metal Assessment ,  except  this spell will determine the value of an item, taking into account the craftsmanship of the item.
8. Phantom Tools III - As Phantom Tools I ,  except the bonus is +30.
9. Sense Power - Caster will be aware of any machine activity or  stored  power for a machine (e.g. capacitors, battery, springs, weights) within the radius of effect. The caster will not know what the  machine  is  or  exactly  where,  though  successful  Perception may give an idea of the number of machines, vague location, and overall energy involved. A Very Hard Perception maneuver while moving at a walking pace or slower with this spell active will give the caster enough warning that he is starting to trigger a mecha -nism for the caster to pull back, avoiding a tripwire or pressure plate activation.
10. Acumen I - Caster receives a +25 bonus to Trading skill and to any Social or Lore skill used to locate a buyer or seller.
11.  Lesser  Item Analysis - Caster gains a general idea  of  an item's  abilities  (e.g.,  it  provides  a  bonus  to  Stealth  [but  not  the amount], it allows casting a spell twice daily [but not which spell], or it does an additional critical in combat [but not what kind or information on the severity of the critical]).
12. Operate II - As Operate I ,  except concentration is not re -quired and the duration is 1 minute per level.
13. Jam II - As Jam I , but the mechanism has only a 4% chance of operating when used/triggered.
14. Detect Significance - Caster can detect any item in the radius which has cultural or historical significance (e.g. a sacred relic, a item formerly possessed by a great hero), and its magnitude (mild significance, great fame, etc), but not the details. Caster can move the area of effect 5' each round by concentrating.
15. Operate III - As Operate II , except duration is 1 hr/level.
16. Phantom Tools V - As Phantom Tools I ,  except the bonus is +50.
17. Acumen II - As Acumen I , except the bonus is +50.
18. Origins - The caster learns the area of origin of the item, the race of the being who made it, and when it was made (within 100 years).
19. Operate IV - As Operate II , except the duration is 1 day per level.
20. Area Jamming - As Jam II , except affects all mechanisms in the area of effect.
25. Item Vision - Caster gets a vision of a significant event in the item's past.
30.  Mental  Operation - Allows caster to operate and control one machine. This not only provides basic motive power (as an Operate spell), but allows full control of an entire machine by the caster alone. Treat as if as many individuals as needed for normal operations  (up  to  a  maximum  equal  to  the  caster's  level)  were working under the perfect command of the caster. Treat the skill of this crew as either +0 or the caster's own bonus in the appropriate skill.
35. Acumen True - As Acumen I , except the bonus is +100.
40. Mass Operate - As Operate II , except affects all machines in the area of effect.
50. Operate True - As Operate II ,  except the duration is per -manent.

  

1. Blur - Causes target to appear blurred to attackers, granting a +10 to the target's DB.
2. Shadow - Target and objects on the target's person appear to be in shadow and thus are almost invisible in dark areas (in many situations this could be handled with a Stalking bonus of between +25 and +75).
3. Façade I - Target has a limited illusion on himself that allows him to look like any humanoid race within 20% of his own size. The illusion moves as the target moves.
4. Signs - [RR Mod: -50] Caster can communicate simple ideas to the target through sign language (yes, no, hungry, good-bye, etc.); to the target it will seem as if the caster were using the gestures appropriate to the target's culture.
5. Displacement I - Target's apparent location is offset from the actual location; all attacks have no effect 10% of the time. Each time a foe misses due to this effect, the chance of that foe missing again goes down 5%.
6. Façade II - As Façade I , except one of the other senses can be added.
7. Impersonation Façade I - As Façade I , except that a specific person  can  be  impersonated  with  regards  to  looks.  The  person must have been observed for at least 1 minute of concentration.
8. Façade III - As Façade I , except two of the other senses can be added.
9. Impersonation Façade II - As Impersonation Façade I , except that one other aspect (or trait) of the person is impersonated. Ad -ditionally, the caster must study the target for at least two minutes of  concentration.  For  example,  the  target's  voice  can  be  imper -sonated.
10. Displacement II - As Displacement I , except chance of miss -ing is 20%.
11.  False  Image -  Creates  a  duplicate  of  the  caster,  which  the caster may concentrate to control and otherwise does exactly what the caster does. The image includes visual and audio components, but no other senses.
12.  Impersonation  Façade  III -  As Impersonation  Façade  I , except that two other aspects (or traits) of the person are imper -sonated. Additionally, the caster must study the target for at least three minutes of concentration. For example, the target's voice and scent can be impersonated.
13. Mass Blur * - As Blur , except as many targets as the caster's level can be affected.
14. Façade V - As Façade I , except all of the other senses may be added.
15. Displacement III - As Displacement I , except chance of miss -ing is 30%.
16. Impersonation Façade IV - As Impersonation Façade I , ex -cept that three other aspects (or traits) of the person are imperson -ated. Additionally, the caster must study the target for at least four minutes of concentration. For example, the target's voice, scent, and subtle mannerisms can be impersonated.
17. Impersonation Study * - The caster may cast this spell and instantly  know  everything  necessary  for Impersonation  Façade spells (i.e., this spell replaces time spent studying the subject to be impersonated).
18.  Mass Shadow - As Shadow ,  except  as  many  targets  as  the caster's level can be affected.
19. Impersonation Façade True - As Impersonation Façade I , except that all aspects of the person are impersonated. Addition -ally,  the  caster must study the target for at least five minutes of concentration. With this spell, even the closest friends and rela -tives of the individual impersonated will have difficulty noticing the façade.
20.  Displacement  IV - As Displacement  III ,  except  chance  of missing is 40%.
25. Mass Façade II - As Façade II , except as many targets as the caster's level can be affected.
30. Displacement V - As Displacement I , except chance of miss -ing is 50%.
35.  Mass Displacement II - As Displacement II ,  except  caster can protect one target per level.
40. Displacement VI - As Displacement I , except chance of miss -ing is 60%.
50.  Changing  Façade -  As Façade  V ,  except  the  caster  can change the façade to a different façade each round.

Note :  If  more  that  one  option  can  be  added  to  the Illusion or Phantasms spell, the same option can be chosen more than once. For Example - with an Illusion III , two options are available. The range could be doubled once to 200' and then doubled again to 400'.

Illusions are one of the more complex and subtle types of magic and they are explained at length in Section 10.10.

  

1. Illusion II - Creates a simple, immobile image or scene within the area of effect. One of the following options may also be cho -sen: a) an  extra  sense  can  be  added  (the  corresponding Mirage spell must be known); b) the duration can be doubled; c) the range can be doubled, d) the radius of the area of effect can be doubled, or e) the illusion can cast light. All parts of the area of effect must be in the caster's field of vision at the time of casting.
2. Phantasms I - Creates the image of one object or being that will move however the caster wants (as long as the caster concen -trates).  When  the  caster  stops  concentrating,  the  image  remains but stops moving. The caster may resume concentration again later and make the image move again (presuming that the duration has not expired). The image can be of any size that would fit within the area of effect.
3. Illusion III - As Illusion II , except any two of the options may be chosen. See notes above for guidelines on how to combine the options.
4. Waiting Illusion II - As Illusion II , except it can be delayed by up to 24 hours. At the time of casting, the caster chooses the trigger for the spell. The caster can choose one of the following:
- a) time  period, b) specified  movements, c) specified  sounds, d) specified smells, e) specified tastes, f) specified touch, or g) a Presence spell cast in the area of effect. If a sense is used to trigger the spell, that sense must be included in the illusion.
5. Phantasms II - As Phantasms I , except one of the following options may also be chosen:
- a) an extra sense can be added (the corresponding Mirage spell must be known); b) the duration can be doubled; c) the range can be  doubled; d) the  radius  of  the  area  of  effect  can  be  doubled; e) another image can be created and moved independently of the first (all separate images must be within the caster's field of vision and within area of effect of the spell); f) the  phantasm can cast light;  or g) limited  repetitious  sounds,  movements,  etc.,  can  be added that do not require concentration of the caster (the proper senses involved must also be included within the illusion).

See notes for guidelines on how to combine the options.

6. Illusion V - As Illusion II , except any four of the options may be chosen.
7. Waiting Phantasm II - As Phantasms II , except it can be de -layed as in Waiting Illusion II . The Phantasm will move and act if given a simple command (e.g., attack, run, etc.) or it can deliver a short speech if sound was one of the senses.
8. Waiting Illusion III - As Waiting Illusion II , except any two of the options may be chosen.
9. Phantasms III - As Phantasms II , except any two of the op -tions may be chosen.
10. Illusion VII As Illusion II , except any six of the options may be chosen.
11. Waiting Phantasm III - As Waiting Phantasm II , except any two of the options may be chosen.
12.  Phantasms IV - As Phantasms II ,  except  any  three  of  the options may be chosen.
13. Waiting Illusion V - As Waiting Illusion II , except any four of the options may be chosen.
14. Phantasm V - As Phantasm II , except any four of the options may be chosen.
15. Illusion X - As Illusion II , except any nine of the options may be chosen.
16. Waiting Phantasm V - As Waiting Phantasm II , except any four of the options may be chosen.
17. Phantasms VII - As Phantasms II , except any six of the op -tions may be chosen.
18. Waiting Illusion VII - As Waiting Illusion II , except any six of the options may be chosen.
19. Illusory Terrain - All of the terrain in the area of effect will appear  differently  than  it  actually  is  (the  corresponding  Terrain spell for each sense incorporated must be known). The caster may designate in what way the terrain is different. For example, a clear -ing in the woods could be disguised as a heavily wooded area of the woods.
20. Phantasms X - As Phantasms II , except any nine of the op -tions may be chosen.
25. Waiting Illusion X - As Waiting Illusion II , except any nine of the options may be chosen.
30. Illusion True - As Illusion X , except its duration is permanent (until dispelled).
35. Illusion XX - As Illusion II ,  except any nineteen of the op -tions may be chosen.
40. Phantasms XX - As Phantasms II , except any nineteen of the options may be chosen.
50.  Phantasms True - As Phantasms X ,  except  its  duration  is permanent  (until  dispelled);  Phantasm  can  move  only  if  caster concentrates,  except  for  simple  programmed  repetitions,  if  that option is chosen.

Note :  Illusions  are  one  of  the  more  complex  and  subtle types of magic and they are explained at length in Section 10.10.

Certain spells on this list have a radius effect that can be cast upon mobile targets (e.g., Light Control, Light, Utterlight, Utterdark ). See Section 10.17 for more.

Consult RMCL Section 15.7 for dealing with light and dark -ness.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Light Mirage - Creates any simple immobile image or scene up to an area of 10'R. The visual aspects of the scene are really created (no RR) and detecting that it is an illusion can normally be accomplished only through spells or the use of a sense other than sight.
2.  Projected  Light -  Beam  of  light  (like  a  flashlight) springs from the caster's palm; it has a 50' effective range. If the caster's hand is closed into a fist, the light will 'turn off'.  If  the  caster's  fist  is  reopened  before  the  end  of  the duration, the light will turn on again.

Note : See Section 10.4 for more about detection spells.

See section 10.21 for a discussion of spells with 'Kind' in their name.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Detect Illusion - Caster can check one object or place (up to a 5'R) and tell if it is an illusion or has an illusion on it.
2. Detect Invisible - Detects any invisible objects or beings; one 5'R area can be checked each round. All attacks against detected targets are modified by -50.
3. Misfeel Kind - For the purposes of mental or magical detections, target appears to be of any race with which the caster is familiar.
4. Misfeel Power I - As Misfeel Kind , except target's level may be misrepresented by 1 level (up or down).
5. Presence Mirage - Creates a false 'presence' of a being for the purposes of magical detection.
6. Misfeel Calling - As Misfeel Kind , except target's pro -fession may be misrepresented.
7. Misfeel Power III - As Misfeel Power I , except target's level may be misrepresented by up to 3 levels.
8. Unpresence Self - Caster becomes undetectable by Presence spells or related abilities.
9. Reduce Power Emanations - Conceals an item's magical  power. Any  attempt  to  detect  its  magical  power  (an appropriate Detect spell  while  it  is  active,  an Attunement attempt, or other means) is hindered. If the item has a single power, then if the detection attempt fails an RR against this spell, it does not register the item's magic. In the case of

multiple  powers,  a  magical  detection  attempt  gains  a  +5 to its RR for each power beyond the first, while someone attempting Attunement (and failing the RR) will be unable to discover one ability (chosen at the time this spell is cast), but may discover and use the remaining powers normally.

10. Misfeel Power V - As Misfeel Power I , except target's level may be misrepresented by up to 5 levels.
11. Disillusion I - While this spell is in effect, one illusion within the caster's range ceases to exist for the caster only. The caster must specify the illusion to be negated (unless caster knows something is an illusion, this spell would be gambling PP).
12. Detect Illusion True - As Detect Illusion , except caster can concentrate on one object or place per round.
13. Misfeel Power X - As Misfeel Power I , except target's level can be misrepresented by up to 10 levels.
14. Disillusion III - As Disillusion I , except up to three il -lusions within the area of effect cease to exist for the caster.
15. Misfeel Multiple - Applies all the lower level Misfeels to a target at once (only one Misfeel Power can be applied).
16. Unpresence I - Target becomes undetectable by Pres -ence spells or related abilities.
17. Disillusion V - As Disillusion I , except up to five illu -sions within the area of effect cease to exist for the caster.
9. 18  Reduce  Power  Emanations  V -  As Reduce  Power Emanations , except affects up to some combination of five powers/targets, i.e. the caster could use this to conceal up to five powers of a single item, three powers of one item and two powers of another item, one power each of five items, etc. .
19. Disillusion True - As Disillusion I , except all illusions within the area of effect cease to exist for the caster.
20. Unpresence V - As Unpresence I , except affects up to five targets.
25. Misfeel Multiple True - As Misfeel Multiple ,  except duration is 1 hour/level.
30. Lord Unpresence - As Unpresence , except 20 targets may be affected.
35. Misfeel Power True - As Misfeel Power I , except tar -get's level may be misrepresented by any number of levels.
40. Presence Mirage True - Creates one false 'presence' of a being for the purposes of magical detection for each level of the caster and these will be located as the caster desires  within  the  area  of  effect.  Caster  may  move  these presence  mirages  by  concentrating  at  a  rate  of  10'/round each.
50. Mass Misfeel Multiple - As Misfeel Multiple , except as many targets as the caster's level can be affected.

1. Smell Mirage - Fills the area of effect with a set of immobile smells. The smells are real (no RR) and detecting that it is an illu -sion can normally only be accomplished through spells or the use of a sense other than smell.
2.  Strike  I -  Target  is  struck  with  the  equivalent  of  a  (Medi -um-sized) bare fist (Martial Arts Striking attack table). The attack is invisible unless combined with the visual sense in an Illusion or Phantasms .  Directed  Spells:  Illusionary Attacks  skill  may  be developed for this attack.
3. Taste Mirage - As Smell Mirage , except a set of tastes can be created in a 10'R.
4. Tear Cloud I - Creates a 10'R cloud of noxious gas that will stun anyone failing to resist (all targets must make RRs each round they  are  in  the  cloud).  Cloud  drifts  with  the  wind.  Targets  are stunned (-50) 1 round per 10 failure.
5. Feel Mirage I - As Smell Mirage ,  except all the objects and surfaces in a 10'R can be made to feel differently than they really are. Striking an object or surface will cancel the spell for that ob -ject or surface only.
6. Feel/Taste/Smell Glamour - One object (up to 10 pounds per level)  has  either  its  taste,  its  smell,  or  the  way  its  surface  feels altered for the duration of the spell. Note that the visual aspects of the object do not change.
7. Strike III - As Strike I , except range increment is 75'.
8.  Numb -  Creates  a  dulling  of  tactile  sensations  in  the  target, especially the hands. Fumble ranges of weapons are increased by 2, applied after any reduction for number of ranks, and all tasks requiring  tactile  feedback  (e.g.,  picking  a  lock,  dancing  with  a partner, playing the piano) are at -25, while Perception rolls for the sense of touch are at -50.
9. Tear Cloud II - As Tear Cloud I , except radius is 20'.
10. Feel Mirage III - As Feel Mirage I , except objects with a feel mirage on them must be struck three times before the feeling is cancelled.
11. Strike V - As Strike I , except range increment is 125'.
12. Feel Terrain - All of the terrain in the area of effect will feel differently  than  it  normally  would. The  caster  may  designate  in what way the terrain  feels  differently.  For  example,  flat  ground could be made to feel rocky or rocky ground could be made to feel flat.
13. Mass Smell/Taste - As many objects as the caster's level can be given individual smells and tastes.
14. Tear Cloud V - As Tear Cloud I , except radius is 50'.
15. Feel Mirage V - As Feel Mirage I , except objects with a feel mirage  on  them  must  be  struck  five  times  before  the  feeling  is cancelled.
16. Mass Feel Mirages - As many objects as the caster's level can be given individual feelings to the touch. Striking an object or surface will cancel the spell for that object only.
17. Striking I - As Strike I , except one attack can be made each round. Target may be changed from one round to another.
18. Feel Mirage VIII - As Feel Mirage I , except objects with a feel mirage on them must be struck eight times before the feeling is cancelled.
19. Tear Cloud X - As Tear Cloud I , except radius is 100'.
20. Feel Mirage X - As Feel Mirage I , except objects with a feel mirage on them must be struck ten times before the feeling is can -celled.
25. Smell Glamour True - Caster can give one object (up to 10 pounds per level) a permanent scent.
30. Taste Glamour True - Caster can give one object (up to 10 pounds per level) a permanent taste.
35. Tear Cloud True - As Tear Cloud I , except radius and range are as listed.
40. Feel Glamour True - Caster can give one object (up to 10 pounds per level) a permanent feel to its surface.

Note : Certain spells on this list have a radius effect that can be cast upon mobile targets (e.g, Sphere of Silence ).  See  Section  10.17 for more.

Illusions are one of the more complex and subtle types of magic and they are explained at length in Section 10.10.

  

1. Sound Mirage - Creates a set of immobile sounds in an area of up to 10'R. The sounds are real (no RR) and detecting that it is an illusion can normally only be accomplished through spells or the use of a sense other than hearing.
2. Sphere of Silence I - Creates a 10'R area into and out of which sound  cannot  travel. As  noted  above,  this  spell  can  be  cast  on an individual target, which the spell will then follow; this target gains  +25  to  Stalking  attempts,  but  likewise  automatically  fails any  Perception  attempts  based  on  hearing  alone  and  suffers  a -50 to Perception rolls where hearing is a factor (e.g., to detect someone Stalking the target). Note that this does not interfere with spell-casting  (the  target  can  still  speak,  even  yell,  the  sound  is simply unable to leave the radius of the Sphere of Silence - certain spells like Ultrasonics may have their range limited to the interior of the Sphere of Silence radius, however).
3. Sound Control I - Caster can control the intensity of sounds within the range; the intensity can vary from none to a very loud shout, and it can be different in different parts of the radius.
4. Sudden Sound - Causes a very loud, sudden sound next to the target's ears; target is stunned (-50) for 1 round per 10 failure.
5. Sound Control V - As Sound Control I , except radius is 50'.
6. Sound Glamour - One object (up to 10 pounds per level) has its sound altered for the duration of the spell. Note that no other aspect of the object changes.
7. Muffle - Target cannot hear sounds occurring more than 6" from the target's ears (or other organs of hearing), and the target's own voice cannot be heard from more than 6" away from the target's mouth (or other organ of speech).
8. Sphere of Silence V - As Sphere of Silence I , except radius is 50'.
9. Minor Ultrasonics - All beings (except the caster) within range capable of hearing ultrasonic sounds are stunned (-50) 1 rnd/10 failure; an RR must be made once per round while in the radius. Even if they are not stunned, animals capable of hearing ultra -sonics will have to make a second, non-magical RR against Fear (level of Fear is half the caster's level).
10. Sound Control X - As Sound Control I , except radius is 100'.
11. Sudden Sound Sphere II - As Sudden Sound , except every -one in a 20'R is affected.
12. Sound Terrain - All of the terrain in the area of effect will have sounds that are different than the terrain's  normal  sounds. The caster may designate in what way the terrain sounds different. For example, an open plain could be made to sound like a rustling forest. Note that only the audio aspect of the terrain changes. This can provide between a -30 to a +30 modification to all Stalking attempts within the terrain,  depending on how 'noisy' the illu -sionary environment is.
13. Sphere of Silence X - As Sphere of Silence I , except radius is 100'.
14. Muffle Sphere - As Muffle , except everyone in a 10'R is af -fected.
15. Greater Sound Control - As Sound Control I , except radius is 10'R/lvl.
16. Long Silence Sphere - As Sphere of Silence I , except range is 10' per level.
17. Long Sound Control - As Sound Contol I ,  except range is 10' per level.
18. Long Sudden Sound - As Sudden Sound , except for range.
19. Long Muffle - As Muffle , except range is 10' per level.
20. Mass Muffling - As Muffle , except as many targets as the cast -er's level can be affected.
25. Mass Quiet - As many targets as the caster's level can have a 1'R silence on them. Except for the radius hugging closer to the body of the target, this functions as described in Sphere of Silence I .
30. Sound Control True - As Sound Control I , except radius is 20'/lvl and the caster does not have to concentrate except to make changes.
35. Sudden Sound Sphere V - As Sudden Sound Sphere II , ex -cept everyone in a 50'R is affected.
40. Sudden Sound Sphere True - As Sudden Sound Sphere II , except everyone in a 100'R is affected and the range is 500'.
50.  Major  Ultrasonics - All  beings  (except  the  caster)  within range  capable  of  hearing  ultrasonic  sounds  are  stunned  (-50)  1 rnd/10 failure; an RR must be made once per round while in the radius. Anyone failing to resist by 40-75 falls unconscious, while anyone failing the RR by more than 75 dies. Even if they are not stunned, animals capable of hearing ultrasonics will have to make a second, non-magical RR against Fear (level of Fear is equal to the caster's level).

Note : See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

  

1. Bake Clay - Caster transforms up to one cubic foot per level of clay into baked pottery. Firing clay in this manner will always be successful. This can also cook glazes onto earthenware. Quality of product depends on the skill of whomever shapes the clay.
2. Loosen Earth - Loosens 100 cubic feet of earth to the consis -tency of plowed ground.
3. Stoneworking - Caster receives a +30 bonus on any maneuvers involving the working of stone.
4. Earthwall - Creates a wall of packed earth up to 10'x10'x (3' at base, 1' at top); it can be dug through only (20 man-rounds at top).
5. Cracks Call - Any previous cracks or flaws in material up to 10'x10'x10' section will extend to their limit.
6. Repair - Caster may mend a single break in a small (up to 2 pounds) inorganic object or multiple breaks, rips, or cracks in a larger (up to 10 pounds) organic object. All component parts of the object must be within a 10' radius.
7.  Stonewall -  Creates  a  wall  of  non-precious  stone  up  to 10'x10'x1'; it can be chipped through or toppled if not against a wall.
8. Earthen Spikes - This spell causes the area of effect to bris -tle with hundreds of 6" to 12" sharp spikes and points. The exact composition of these spikes will depend on the material the ground is  made of. The area of effect must be placed horizontally on a surface (i.e., it cannot be placed on walls). Most animals and crea -tures cannot be induced to walk through the area. Anyone moving through the area must make a maneuver roll (at least Extremely Hard  difficulty)  for  every  5'  moved  through. Anyone  who  falls inside the area of effect receives an A Puncture critical strike.
9. Stone/Earth - Changes 100 cubic feet of stone to packed earth. This change is gradual, taking three rounds to complete.
10. Earthwall True - As Earthwall , except duration is permanent.
11.  Earth/Mud - As Stone/Earth ,  except  changes  earth  to  soft mud.
12. Earth/Stone - As Stone/Earth , except changes packed earth to solid stone and loose earth to gravel.

15. Unearth - Disintegrates 100 cubic feet of earth.
16. Meld Walls - Fuses two touching walls together (seam can be up to 20' long) or fuses a section of stone blocks (up to 100 cubic feet).
17. Stone/Mud - As Stone/Earth , except changes stone to mud.
18. Curved Stonewall - As Stonewall True , except wall may be curved to a semicircle.
19. Unflaw - Removes a flaw from a single gem, mineral, or stone. This can greatly enhance the value of some jewels.
20. Unstone - Disintegrates 100 cubic feet of stone.
25. Unmetal - Disintegrates 1 cubic foot of metal.
30. Tremors - Causes a very minor earthquake which could cause shoddy construction to collapse (and can be very terrifying). This is approximately 5.5 on the Richter scale.
35. Great Wall of Stone - As Stonewall True , except wall may be curved as desired so long as total length does not exceed 10' per level and wall is two feet thick.
40. Animate Stone - Transforms one stone into a stone golem (sophistication of shape depending on caster's artistic skills) for the duration of the spell, during which it will obey the caster faith -fully unless control is wrested by another (in which case the caster can always cancel the spell and return the golem to boulder form before duration runs out). Size of the golem is based on the stone's weight (which may be modified up to 50% in order to achieve desired Size) and may be up to Large.
50. Earth Mastery - Caster can use one lower level spell (on this list) each round.

Note : See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

  

1. Boiling Heat - For each level of the caster, one cubic foot of liquid can be heated to boiling at a rate of 1 cubic foot per round. Once the caster ceases concentration, the liquid (if any remains) will cool normally.
2. Warm Solid - Any solid, inanimate, non-metal material (up to 1 cubic foot per level) can be warmed to 100°F (38°C) at a rate of 1 cubic foot per round.
3.  Woodfires -  Causes  any  wood  to  ignite  and  burn. All  wood ignited must be within 1' of caster's palm.
4. Wall of Fire - Creates an opaque wall of fire (up to 10'x10'x6"). Anyone passing through it takes an A Heat critical (no RR).
5. Heat Solid - As Warm Solid , except for duration and material can be heated to 500°F (260°C) at a rate of one cubic foot heated by  100°F  (56°C)  per  round.  The  caster  must  concentrate  to  in -crease  the  temperature  (without  concentration,  the  material  will retain its current temperature for the duration of the spell).
6. Fire Bolt I - A bolt of fire is shot from the palm of the caster; results are determined on the Fire Bolt Table.
7.  Call  Flame  I -  Creates  a  cube  of  flame  (up  to  10'x10'x10'); it  takes 1 complete round for the cube to form and be effective. Anyone passing through (or caught within) the cube takes an A Heat critical each round spent in the cube.
8. Fire Ball - A 1' diameter ball of fire is shot from the palm of the caster. Upon reaching the selected target/location, it expands to affect a 10'R area. Resolve attack on the Fire Ball Table.
9. Ignite - The caster may designate a type of light source to ig -nite or extinguish (e.g., candles, torches, fireplaces, or lanterns). This spell will affect all of the light sources of the specified type(s) within the area of effect.
10. Circle Aflame - As Wall of Fire , except 'wall' is 10' high and forms a 10'R circle (6" thick) with the caster at the center (it is non-mobile).
11. Fire Bolt III - As Fire Bolt I , except range increment is 75'.
12.  Call  Flame  II -  As Call  Flame  I ,  except  cube  is  up  to 20'x20'x20' in size and the range is 20'.
13. Waiting Flame - As Call Flame I ,  except the effect can be delayed for up to 24 hours. The effect can be triggered by one of the following (decided by the caster at time of casting): time period, certain movements, certain sounds, touch, violent actions in the area, or any other trigger so long as the caster would be able to sense it if the caster remained at the area of effect.
14. Firestorm - As Call Flame I , except small balls of flame rain down in a 10' cube causing a B Heat critical to all within or passing through the area of effect.
15. Metal Fires - Causes a metal object to burst into flames, the object can be up to 1 lb/level in mass. If the object is on a being, it  gets  an  RR,  and  if  it  fails,  the  being  takes  an  automatic  Heat critical of a severity to be determined by its location on the being's body.  If  the  object  is  touching  exposed  flesh,  the  being  takes  a C Heat critical; if the object is touching through cloth, the being takes a B Heat critical; any being within a 1'R takes an A Heat critical.
16. Triad of Flame - Three bolts of fire are shot from the palm of the caster. They can strike up to three different targets as long as they are all within 60° of each other and are within the caster's field of vision. Caster may apply his Directed Spell skill by divid -ing it as he chooses among the three bolts (e.g., a +120 OB could be split evenly into three +40 bolts or one +120 bolt and two +0 bolts or one +60, one +40, and one +20 bolt).
17. Fire Bolt V - As Fire Bolt I , except range increment is 125'.
18. Waiting Firestorm - As Waiting Flame ,  except a Firestorm can be delayed.
19. Call Flame V - As Call Flame I , except the size is up to a 50' cube and the range is 50'.
20. Corner Fires - As Fire Bolt III , except caster can make the bolt turn once by up to 90° before striking the target (the caster must know the target's location). The caster's OB is modified by -25 when using this spell. However, this spell can be used to by -pass a positional modifier - any DB  bonus gained through the use of cover (partial/half/full soft cover; partial/half/full hard cover) is reduced to zero if the turn circumvents the cover; a target that oth -erwise would be unable to be hit can be attacked using this spell.
25. Following Fires - As Corner Fires , except bolt can make as many turns as necessary, with an OB penalty of -25 per turn, and go through openings (must be larger than 6" radius) to strike the target.
30. Stone Fires - A stone surface of up to 300 sq. ft. bursts into flames, and a C Heat critical is given each round to anything pass -ing through (or spending the round in) the 3' flames.
35. Following Fires True - As Following Fires , except there is no penalty to OB.
40. Dragon's Fire - A cone of fire resembling the breath weapon of a fire-breathing dragon shoots from the caster's hand or face, with a diameter of 1' at its origin point at the caster increasing to a diameter of 50' at the termination of the cone 100' away. Results of this attack are determined using the Fire Ball table.
50. Fire Mastery - Caster can use any one lower level spell (on this list) each round.

  

1. Freezing Cold - The caster may decrease the temperature of any inanimate body of liquid of up to 1 cubic foot per level by up to 100°F (56°C) per round. Once the liquid begins to freeze it will not continue to cool, and will begin to warm naturally if the caster stops concentrating. (Temp. cannot be lower then -20°F[-29°C]).
2.  Cool  Solid -  Any  solid,  inanimate,  non-metal  material  can be cooled to -20°F (-29°C), at a rate of 1 cubic foot per round (cooling spreads evenly from initial point of cooling unless caster concentrates to direct spread).
3. Wall of Cold - Creates a wall of intense cold (up to 10'x10'x1'), normally visible as mist condenses out of the air. Anyone passing through takes an A Cold critical (no RR).
4. Ice Passage - While this spell lasts, the caster can walk through ice as if it were air. The caster will not drop through ice if he enters it in the middle of a tall ice formation, as under his feet, the ice will still be solid for him and provide good footing.
5. Chill Solid - As Cool Solid , except material can be cooled to -200°F (-129°C), at a rate of cooling one cubic foot of material by 100°F (56°C) each round. The caster must concentrate to decrease the temperature (without concentration, the material will retain its current temperature for the duration of the spell).
6. Ice Bolt I - A bolt of ice is shot from the palm of the caster. Results are resolved on the Ice Bolt Table.
7. Cold Ball II - A 1' ball of cold is shot from the palm of the caster.  Upon  reaching  the  selected  target/location,  it  expands  to affect a 20'R area. Resolve attacks on the Cold Ball Table.
8. Icewall I - Creates a wall of ice up to 10'x10'x (2' at base, 1' at top); it can be melted through or chipped through or toppled if not against a wall.
9. Call Cold I - Creates a cube of cold (up to 10'x10'x10') similar to a Wall of Cold ; it takes 1 complete round for the cube to form and be effective. Anyone passing through (or caught within) the cube takes an A Cold critical each round spent in the cube.
10. Circle of Cold - As Wall of Cold , except the 'wall' is 10' high and forms a 20'R circle (6" thick) with the caster at the center. The wall will not move with the caster.
11. Ice Bolt III - As Ice Bolt I , except range increment is 75'.
12. Water/Ice - Changes 10 cubic feet per level of water to ice, instantly.
13. Cold Metal - Chills metal to the point that it becomes extreme -ly brittle (1 object only), giving it a -50 penalty to its strength and the object will be subject to a breakage check if it strikes another object  or  is  struck. Anyone  in  direct  skin-to-metal  contact  with the chilled metal will take a B Cold Critical each round contact is maintained.
14. Call Cold II - As Call Cold I , except the size is up to a 20' cube and the range is 20'.
15. Ice Bolt V - As Ice Bolt I , except range increment is 125'.
16. Triad of Ice - Three bolts of ice are shot from the palm of the caster. They can strike up to three different targets as long as they are all within 60° of each other and are within the caster's field of vision. Caster may apply his Directed Spell skill by dividing it as he chooses among the three bolts (e.g., a +120 OB could be split evenly into three +40 bolts or one +120 bolt and two +0 bolts or one +60, one +40, and one +20 bolt).
17. Wall of Frigidity - As Wall of Cold , except it lasts for 1 min -ute  per  level  and  does  a  D  Cold  Critical  to  anyone  who  passes through it.
18. Call Cold V - As Call Cold I , except size is up to a 50' cube and the range is 50'.
19. Ice Bolt X - As Ice Bolt I , except range increment is 250'.
20. Cold Ball IV - As Cold Ball II , except area of effect is 40'R and the range is 300'.
25.  Rain/Snow -  For  as  long  as  it  continues  to  rain,  this  spell changes all rain within 1 mile of the caster to snow; radius de -creases 500' for every 10°F (5.5°C) the ambient air temperature is above freezing (32°F) (0°C).
30. Cold True - Causes the ambient temperature in the area of effect to drop 1°F (0.6°C) every ten minutes with a maximum re -duction equal to the caster's level in degrees Fahrenheit (within a 1000'/lvl R).
35. Call Cold X - As Call Cold I , except size is up to a 100' cube and the range is 100'.
40. Cold Ball VI - As Cold Ball II , except area of effect is 60'R and the range is 500'.
50. Cold Mastery - Caster can use any one lower level spell (on this list) each round.

Note : Certain spells on this list have a radius effect that can be  cast  upon  mobile  targets  (e.g, Light , Darkness , Utterlight , Utterdark ). See Section 10.17 for more.

Consult RMCL Section 15.7 for dealing with light and dark -ness.

  

1.  Projected  Light -  Beam  of  light  (like  a  flashlight) springs from the caster's palm; it has a 50' effective range. If the caster's hand is closed into a fist, the light will 'turn off'.  If  the  caster's  fist  is  reopened  before  the  end  of  the duration, the light will turn on again.
2. Shock Bolt I - A bolt of intense, charged light is shot from the palm of the caster; results are determined on the Lightning Bolt attack table, as a Miniscule attack.
3. Light I - Lights a 10'R area about the point touched.
4.  Shade - All  shadows  and  darkness  within  the  area  of effect  deepen,  giving  all  Perception  maneuvers  involving seeing anything hidden/hiding in the area a penalty of -20. Area is not mobile.
5. Sudden Light - Causes a 10'R burst of intense light, all within are stunned (-50) for 1 round per 10 failure.
6. Darkness I - Reduces illumination to a dark night in a 10'R area about the point touched.
7. Light V - As Light I , except radius can be up to 50' (can be changed by concentrating 1 round).
8. Shock Bolt III - As Shock Bolt I , except range increment is 75'.
9. Darkness V - As Darkness I , except radius is 50'.
10. Lightning Bolt I - A bolt of lightning is shot from the caster's palm; resolve attack on the Lightning Bolt Attack Table as a Medium-sized attack.
11. Waiting Lighting - In conjunction with any Light or Darkness spell  (i.e.,  this  spell  is  cast  and  then  the Light/ Darkness spell is cast) it can delay the action of that spell up to 24 hours; it can be triggered by one selected trigger (decided  by  the  caster):  time  period,  certain  movements, certain  sounds,  touch,  violent  actions  in  the  area,  or  any other trigger so long as the caster would be able to sense it if the caster remained at the area of effect.
12. Shock Bolt V - As Shock Bolt I , except range increment is 125'.
13. Beacon V - Ray of light of any color springs from cast -er's palm; it can be up to 5 miles long.
14. Magic Lantern - As Light I , except radius is 30', du -ration  is  1  hour  per  level,  and  spell  must  be  cast  upon  a non-living organic object, like a wooden staff or leather cap.
15. Lightning Bolt III - As Lightning Bolt I , except range increment is 75'.
16. Shock Bolt X - As Shock Bolt I , except range increment is 250'.
17. Utterlight - Nullifies all magically created darkness in a 100'R, and lights that area as full daylight.
18. Utterdark - Darkens a 100'R area, no light (except Utterlight ) can exist within this radius.
19. Beacon X - As Beacon V , except beacon can be up to 10 miles long.
20. Lightning Bolt V - As Lightning Bolt I , except range increment is 125'.
25. Corner Lightning Bolt - As Lightning Bolt III , except caster  can  make  the  bolt  turn  once  by  up  to  90°  before striking the target (the caster must know the target's loca -tion). The caster's OB is modified by -25 when using this spell. However, this spell can be used to bypass a positional modifier - any DB bonus gained through the use of cover (partial/half/full  soft  cover;  partial/half/full  hard  cover)  is reduced to zero; a target that otherwise would be unable to be hit can be attacked this spell.
30. Following Lightning Bolt - As Corner Lightning Bolt , except bolt can make as many turns as necessary, with an OB penalty of -25 per turn, and go through openings (must be larger than 6" radius) to strike the target.
35. Corona - Caster is surrounded by a blazing electrical aura. This illuminates a 30' radius, but more importantly, it  also  provides  a  defensive  (or  rather,  counter-offensive) effect.  Anyone  attacking  the  caster  in  melee  receives  an electrical  critical  of  the  same  severity  as  that  suffered  by the caster. This is not scaled by target size. If a massive troll does an E+A critical to a Magician surrounded by a Corona , the troll takes an E+A Electricity critical in return.
40.  Utterlight True - As Utterlight ,  except  that  duration is 10 minutes per level and the radius illuminated is 10' per level.
50. Light Mastery - Caster can use one lower level spell (on this list) each round.

Note : See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

  

1.  Condensation -  Condenses  1  cubic  foot  of  water  from  the surrounding air. Condensation can be channeled into any suitable receptacle, including caster's cupped hands.
2.  Fog - Creates dense fog within the area of effect. Treat as a heavy fog as described in RMCL Section 15.7. Fog disperses nat -urally after creation (this can mean lingering for days in suitable environments).
3. Waterwall - Creates a wall of water up to 10'x10'x1'. This wall requires 2 AP to cross, the pace of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by two (e.g, a Run going in would be a Walk pace coming out) to a minimum of a Walk, and attacks through the wall suffer a -80 penalty.
4. Water Bolt I - A bolt of water is shot from the caster's palm; results are determined on the Water Bolt Table.
5. Unfog - Disperses fog within the area of effect. If not all of a fog is dispersed (i.e., the fog covers a greater area than the area of effect for this spell), the fog will refill the area of effect, reducing the cleared radius by 10' every 1-5 minutes (varying depending on the heaviness of the fog and ambient humidity).
6.  Quench - Target's fluids are immediately replenished, elimi -nating any dehydration that the target may have been suffering. This spell also meets the target's water needs for the next 24 hours, not including losses directly due to magic (i.e., it will not defend against a Dessication spell, but will cure its effects if cast after).
7. Steam Bolt I - As Water Bolt I , except that if the caster knows the Fire Law list to 7th level, this bolt becomes scalding hot, trail -ing thick tendrils of steam behind it. It uses the Water Bolt Table, but in addition to the normal results, it does an additional Steam critical one level of severity less than the usual critical.
8. Calm Water - All water within a 100'R is calmed; waves are cut by 20' in the center and less towards the perimeter. This will negate the effects of currents in the area of effect.
9.  Drowning  Trap - An  area  of  water  is  made  hostile  to  any air-breather who intrudes upon it. Powerful undertows will appear out of nowhere and sudden currents seem to grab at the victim. Swimming maneuvers are made at -100 within the area of effect.
10. Waterwall True - As Waterwall ,  except the caster need not concentrate and the duration is 1 min/level.
11. Water Bolt III - As Water Bolt I , except range increment is 75'.
12. Buoyancy - A region of water becomes slightly denser, mak -ing it easier to float. All Swimming maneuvers to avoid drowning or to move at or near the surface of the water gain a +30 bonus.
13. Call Rain - If there are clouds in the sky, it rains outdoors for the duration of the spell.
14. Steam Bolt III - As Steam Bolt I , except range increment is 75' and Fire Law must be known to 14th level in order to transform the Water Bolt into a Steam Bolt.
15. Water Bolt V - As Water Bolt I , except the range increment is 125'.
16. Triad of Water - Three bolts of water are shot from the palm of the caster. They can strike up to three different targets as long as they are all within 60° of each other and are within the caster's field of vision. Caster may apply his Directed Spell skill by divid -ing it as he chooses among the three bolts (e.g., a +120 OB could be split evenly into three +40 bolts or one +120 bolt and two +0 bolts or one +60, one +40, and one +20 bolt).
17. Command Current - The area of effect for this spell is the water  immediately  surrounding  the  boat  that  the  caster  is  on (where 'boat' should be interpreted loosely; a log is a 'boat' for purposes of this spell if the caster is riding it on water). For as long as the caster concentrates, the speed of the boat can be increased by 25' per round (approximately 3 miles per hour).
18. Calm Water True - As Calm Water ,  except  radius  is  100'/ lvl and waves are cut by 50' in the center and caster need not con -centrate.
19. Mass Quench - As Quench , except affects up to one target/ level and can target anyone within 100'.
20. Whirlpool - Creates a whirlpool with a 50 foot radius in any liquid body that will draw in any objects in the liquid up to 500' away.  Objects  capable  of  moving  under  their  own  power  may make a Very Hard maneuver to resist the pull of the whirlpool.
25. Part Water - Caster can part water up to 100' deep and 100'/ lvl long and 10' wide at bottom (50' at top).
30. Sea Storm - Summons forces of nature in a fierce sea storm (must be created over a large body of water). This storm will in -clude waves of 20-50', heavy rain, and winds of 25-60 mph. The storm can be delayed up to 1 hour/level after casting the spell. After the storm has been summoned, it will dissipate normally.
35.  Current Mastery - As Command Current ,  except  speed  is increased by 50' per round.
40. Maelstrom - As Whirlpool , except caster need not concentrate as  the  Maelstrom lasts 10 minutes per level on its own and the maneuver to resist the pull is Extremely Hard.
50. Water Mastery - Caster can use one lower level spell (on this list) each round.

Note : See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.

All vacuums created by the spells on this list also create a loud noise. The larger  the  radius  the  louder  the  noise. The  GM  may wish to rule that all within the radius must make a second RR or be deafened for 1 round per 10 failure (RR attack level equals the radius of the vacuum).

An elemental creature made of gas will be reduced to 1 AP per round if successfully attacked with an Air Stop spell (the creature must fit into the area of effect). A Vacuum thrown at a creature made of gas will result in a Slaying IV Critical on the creature.

  

1. Breezes - Causes a light breeze as long as the caster concen -trates. The breeze moves any gasses in the area as the caster di -rects, up to 20' per round.
2. Airwall - Creates a wall of dense churning air up to 10'x10'x3'. This  wall  requires  1  AP  to  cross,  the  pace  of  anyone  moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by one (e.g, a Run going in would be a Jog coming out), and attacks through the wall suffer a -50 penalty.
3. Slumber Mist - By concentrating, the caster can remove most of the oxygen from the area of effect. After three rounds of con -centration, all targets in the area of effect must make an RR each round in the area of effect or fall asleep (1 round per 10 failure). All  fire  spells  in  the  area  suffer  a  -20  penalty  (or  are  20%  less effective in the case of non-attack spells).
4. Stun Cloud I - Creates a 5'R cloud of charged gas particles. The cloud takes one round to form, so anyone in the radius when it is cast may make a maneuver to move out of the radius without taking a critical; however, after that anyone within the radius at anytime in the round takes the critical indicated (a maximum of one per round). Following the initial formation round, the cloud delivers a C Electricity critical to all within the area of effect on the  first  and  second  rounds,  a  B  critical  on  the  third  and  fourth rounds, and an A critical on the fifth and sixth rounds, after which it dissipates. It drifts with the wind.
5. Air Stop I - Stops all generalized air movement up to winds of 30 mph and cuts higher winds by 30 mph in a 10' radius.
6. Stun Cloud II - As Stun Cloud I , except radius is 10'.
7. Vacuum I - Creates a 5' radius of near vacuum; all within the radius take a B Impact critical as the air leaves and rushes back in (if they fail an RR).
8. Air Stop II - As Air Stop I , except radius is 20'.
9. Slumber Cloud - As Slumber Mist , except for the duration and that it drifts with the wind.
10. Stun Cloud IV - As Stun Cloud I , except radius is 20'.
11. Death Cloud I - As Stun Cloud I , except delivers an E critical on rounds 1 and 2, a D on rounds 3 and 4, a C on rounds 5 and 6, a B on rounds 7 and 8, and an A on rounds 9 and 10, after which it dissipates.
12. Vacuum II - As Vacuum I , except radius is 10'.
13. Air Stop X - As Air Stop I , except radius is 100'.
14. Whirlwind - A 10'R whirlwind is created, taking one round to form. It delivers an A Impact critical to all inside (every round). It requires 2 AP to enter or exit the whirlwind, and pace is limited to a walk within it and all Movement maneuvers are Very Hard at a minimum. The caster can move the whirlwind 10' per round (does not require concentration, but caster must be able to see the whirlwind).
15. Death Cloud II - As Death Cloud I , except radius is 10' and range is 40'.
16.  Crosswinds -  Creates  an  area  of  constantly  shifting  winds. Any missile passing through this region suffers a -100 penalty to its OB and elemental bolt attacks suffer this penalty as well, except for Shock and Lightning Bolts. Any sailing vessel caught in these crosswinds will be unable to make any significant progress.
17. Vacuum IV - As Vacuum I , except radius is 20'.
18. Great Vacuum - As Vacuum I ,  except  delivers  a  D  Impact critical.
19. Stun Cloud True - As Stun Cloud IV , except by concentrating the caster can move it 10'/round up to 100' away.
20. Reverse Winds - Allows the caster to change the direction of the wind within the radius.
25.  Hard  Wind - A  hard  wind  comes  forth  from  caster's  out -stretched arms, fanning out to reach a 100' wide span at a distance of 200'. All within the cone receive a B Unbalancing critical.
30. Vacuum VIII - As Vacuum I , except radius is 40'.
35. Summon Storm - Summons forces of nature in a fierce thun -derstorm which includes heavy rain, 25-60 mph winds, lightning (random) and a blizzard (if correct climate). Can be delayed up to 1 hour/level after casting.
40. Death Cloud V - As Death Cloud I , except radius is 25' and range is 100'.
50. Wind Mastery - Caster can use one lower level spell (on this list) each round.

Note : When allowed to choose more than one option on summon -ing spells, the same option may be chosen more than once. For ex -ample, with a Summons III , two options are available. This means that if both options are used for the same thing, then three first-lev -el creatures could be summoned, or one third-level creature could be summoned, or one first-level creature could be summoned for four times as long.

Because of  the  extremely  strong  and  intimate  bond  created  be -tween caster and familiar, any attempt to dispel this bond suffers a penalty of 100 (normally a +100 bonus to the bond's RR against the dispelling attempt). Investitures have only a bias of 50 in their favor, but must be undone one by one, starting from the highest level Investiture down to the last. Only once all Investiture spells are dispelled may the Familiar bond be subject to dispelling.

  

1.  Familiar - The caster can attune himself to a small creature of animal intelligence (i.e., with the Animalistic flaw) to serve as his familiar. The caster must obtain the creature (which can be no more than 10% of caster's own mass) through normal means and cast the spell on the animal once each day for 1 week (associating with the animal for 2 hours each day). The caster can then control the familiar and view the world through its senses by concentrating on it (must be within 50' per caster level). If the animal is killed, the caster will have a -25 modification to all actions for 2 weeks.

2. Summons I - Caster can instantly summon a first level non-in -telligent (i.e., possessing the Animalistic or Mindless flaw) living creature,  which  appears  somewhere  with  the  spell's  range.  The caster can specify the general type of creature, but exactly what the creature is should be determined randomly (e.g., the caster could specify 'four-legged, hoofed' and could get a zebra, horse, camel, etc.). If the creature can understand the caster's communication, the creature can be controlled by normal communication. Other -wise, control is maintained through concentration of the caster. If the creature summoned is used for a task that is not dangerous (in its own perception), the duration for this spell is 10 minutes per level. However, if the creature is ever put into a dangerous situa -tion, the duration immediately drops to 1 round per level. At the end of the spell's duration, the summoned creature will disappear back to whence it came.

3.  Investiture  I -  This  spell  is  cast  upon  the  caster's  familiar. However, the familiar  must  be  a  type  of  animal  that  is  usually associated with evil in the caster's culture. This spell transfers part of the caster's 'life' into the familiar. This spell must be cast upon the familiar every day for a month (associating with the animal for 2 hours a day). The familiar retains all of its old abilities and it  gains  special  abilities. The familiar will become a malformed version of the animal it once was (more grotesque). The caster can view the world through the senses of the creature at a range of 250' per level. The creatures AT changes to 3 (if not already higher), and it gains a +10 to its DB and OB. The caster can cast spells through the familiar as if the caster were actually where the famil -iar is (this includes casting 'self' spells on the familiar): range for this ability is 50' per level. The creature will make all of its RRs at half the caster's level or its own level, whichever is higher. The familiar can be sent on long-range missions, although it will be limited in its ability to interpret ambiguous instructions or adapt to unexpected events. It can always find its way back to the caster through their  bond  unless  the  caster  is  magically  hidden.  If  the familiar dies, the caster will lose one quarter of his Power Points and Concussion Hits for 1-5 weeks (and these cannot be restored by any means until the time has passed).

4. Summons II - As Summons I ,  except the caster chooses one of the following options: a) the level of the summoned creature is increased by one, b) an extra 1st level creature can be summoned, or c) the duration can be doubled. When applying options to the higher level Summons spells, option 'a' can only be applied to one creature at a time (i.e., two 2nd level creatures takes three options: one for the second creature and one each to raise the creatures to 2nd level).

5. Binding II - Caster can bind one creature (up to second level) with animal intelligence (i.e., with the Animalistic flaw). The bound creature must follow the commands of the caster (the caster does not have to concentrate). The caster can only have as many creatures bound as he has levels. If the creature is ever outside the range of the spell, the spell is dispelled.

6. Summons III - As Summons II , except two options are chosen.

7.  Order  Bound  II -  The  target  of  this  spell  is  any  creature with animal intelligence (i.e., with the Animalistic flaw) that has been bound (with a Binding spell). The caster can give a simple, straight-forward task for the creature to attempt to complete. The creature will do its best to complete the task (within the duration of the spell). When the duration of this spell expires, the creature returns to its normal 'unbound' state. Once this spell is cast, the creature can leave the range of the spell without ending its dura -tion.
8. Summons V - As Summons II , except four options are chosen.
9. Binding V - As Binding II , except binds up to a 5th level crea -ture.

10. Summons VII - As Summons II ,  except six options may be chosen.

11. Investiture II - The target of this spell is a familiar that has had Investiture I successfully cast on it. This spell puts more of the  caster  into  his  familiar. The  caster  must  cast  this  spell  once per day for six months (spending two hours each day). The caster can use the familiar's senses up to 1,000 feet per level away and can cast spells through the familiar up to 200' per level away. The creature's AT improves to 5, the DB bonus improves to +20 and

the OB bonus improves to +30, and it makes RRs at the higher of its own level or three fourths of the caster's level. It also gains a venomous attack that is used in conjunction with its normal attack (poison type of the caster's choice, equal level to the familiar). The appearance of the familiar becomes even more grotesque, be -ginning to assume aspects of the caster's appearance. The change may be extreme enough to make it unrecognizable as the animal it was. If the familiar dies, the caster loses half his Power Points and Concussion Hits for 1-5 weeks.

12. Summons X - As Summons II , except nine options are chosen.
13. Binding X - As Binding II ,  except binds up to a 10th level creature.
14. Summons XII - As Summons II ,  except  eleven options are chosen.
15. Order Bound X - As Order Bound II , except maximum du -ration is 10 hours.
16. Summons XV - As Summons II , except fourteen options are chosen.
17. Binding XV - As Binding II , except binds up to a 15th level creature.
18. Summons XVII - As Summons II , except sixteen options are chosen.
19. Investiture III - The target of this spell is a familiar that has had Investiture II successfully cast on it. This spell puts even more of the caster into his familiar. The caster must cast this spell once per day for one year (spending two hours each day). The caster can use the familiar's senses up to 1 mile per level away and can cast spells through the familiar up to 1000' per level away. The creature's AT improves to 7, the DB bonus improves to +30 and the OB bonus improves to +50, and it makes RRs at the higher of  its  own  level  or  the  caster's  level.  It  retains  its  venom  from Investiture II .  Its  form becomes completely grotesque and could not be associated with the animal it once was. If the familiar dies, the caster loses three quarters of his Power Points and Concussion Hits for 1-5 weeks.
20.  Lord Summons - As Summons II ,  except  nineteen  options are chosen.
25. Binding True - As Binding II , except binds a creature of any level.
30. Order Bound True - As Order Bound II ,  except maximum duration is 1 hour per caster's level.
35. Mass Summons - As Summons II , except a number of options equal to the caster's level are chosen.
40. Investiture IV - The target of this spell is a familiar that has had Investiture  III successfully  cast  on  it.  This  spell  puts  even more of the caster into his familiar. The caster must cast this spell once per day for two years (spending two hours each day). The caster can use the familiar's senses up to 10 miles per level away and can cast spells through the familiar up to 1 mile per level away. The creature's AT improves to 9, the DB bonus improves to +50 and the OB bonus improves to +75, and it continues to make RRs at the higher of its own level or the caster's level. It retains its ven -om from Investiture II , but potency is the higher of the familiar's level or the caster's level. It cannot really become more grotesque. If  the  familiar  dies,  the  caster  loses  all  of  his  Power  Points  and Concussion Hits for 1-5 weeks, spending that period in a coma.
50. Summoning Mastery - Caster can use any lower level spell on this list, once per round.

Note :  The  exact  form  of  these  transformations  will  vary from caster to caster, but they will always be more or less horrific.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Bulging Eyes - Caster's eyes enlarge. Caster gains a +20 to Perception rolls involving vision exclusively and a +10 to Perception rolls involving vision along with other senses. Any vision enhancement spells cast on the caster while this spell is active will last until this spell expires or their normal duration, whichever is longer.
2.  Armoring  I -  Caster's  skin  and  subcutaneous  fat  are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 2.  This covers the entire body and constitutes a full set of armor.
3. Prehensile Tail - Caster grows a prehensile tail strong enough to support his own weight.
4. Tentacles - Caster grows several tentacles, which can be used to make an attack on the Grapple Attack Table without occupying the caster's hands. The size of the attack is the same as the size of the caster. The OB of the attack is the caster's skill in this list.
5. Armoring II -  Caster's  skin  and  subcutaneous  fat  are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 3.  This covers the entire body and constitutes a full set of armor.
6. Wings I - Caster grows wings. Caster can now fly at a rate equal to his normal walking speed. He can fly at faster paces, but must make Endurance rolls as if moving one pace faster than actual, with movement at Dash pace requiring an Endurance roll every round at a -20 penalty.

7. Horns - Caster grows horns, which can be used to make an attack on the Horn Attack Table. The size of the attack is the same as the size of the caster. The OB of the attack is the caster's skill in this list.

8. Armoring III - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 4.

9. Claws - Caster grows clawed hands, which can be used to make an attack on the Claw Attack Table. The size of the attack is the same as the size of the caster. The OB of the attack is the caster's skill in this list.

10. Wings II - As Wings I ,  except Fatigue checks are as normal for the pace of movement and any maneuver rolls related to flight are made with a +20 bonus.

11. Armoring IV - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 5.  This covers the entire body and constitutes a full set of armor.

12. Bite - Caster grows fangs or teeth suitable for attacks, which can be used to make an attack on the Bite Attack Table. The size of the attack is the same as the size of the caster. The OB of the attack is the caster's skill in this list.

13. Spines - Caster grows spiny projections. Any time the caster is attacked unarmed or with a weapon less than onehalf the caster's height in length, the attacker will suffer an attack resolved on the Stinger Attack Table. The size of the attack is the same as the size of the caster. The OB of the attack is half the caster's skill in this list. This attack is auto -matic and does not require an action by the caster.

14. Wings III - As Wings II , except base speed is twice the caster's normal walking pace.

15. Armoring V - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 6.  This covers the entire body and constitutes a full set of armor.

16. Killer Instincts - When using the attacks provided by spells on this list, the caster can substitute his skill in this list  for  any one of the following Combat Expertise skills: Disarm, Multiple Attacks, Restricted Quarters, or Reverse Strike. The skill to which this applies may be different each round.
17. Envenom - The attack provided by Horns , Claws , Bite , or Spines will  deliver a poison upon doing a critical. The level of the poison is the caster's level. Only one attack be -comes poisonous, but this spell can be cast multiple times if the caster has cast more than one of the listed spells active. Caster determines the type of poison. This spell lasts as long as the spell whose attack it is enhancing.

18. Armoring VI - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 7.  This covers the entire body and constitutes a full set of armor.

19. Spinnerets - Caster grows a group of spinnerets somewhere on his body, which can be used to make webs. This can be used to create up to 100' of silk rope per round, ca -pable of withstanding a thousand pounds of weight. Webs can be sticky in some parts and not in others, allowing the creation of anchored bridges made of webbing. The webs can also be launched with the ranges of a javelin, with the attack resolved on the Grapple Attack Table. The size of the attack is the same as the size of the caster. The OB of the attack is the caster's skill in this list.
20. Armoring VII - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 8.  This covers the entire body and constitutes a full set of armor.
25. Foul Breath - Caster begins to exhale a toxic gas (cast -er is immune to the effects). Any living thing coming within 10' of the caster must make an RR versus poison each round or  suffer  a  cumulative  -5  penalty  and  take  1d10  damage from the effects of the gas. Treat the penalty as organ dam -age  (lungs)  for  treatment/healing  purposes  and  the  final penalty as a single injury. Level of the poison is the level of the caster. Caster can also exhale a 50' long cone, reaching a width of 25' at its furthest extent, but this requires such effort that an Endurance roll is called for.
30. Armoring VIII - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 9.
35. Adapted  Form -  Caster's  body  adapts  to  survive  in environmental conditions. This can involve submersion in freezing water at depths with crushing pressure, traversing molten lava, enduring exposure to a raging sandstorm, or withstanding the bizarre conditions of an alien dimension. This  does  not  cover  any  form  of  deliberate  attack  (even while comfortable naked in a blizzard, the caster will still suffer normal damage from a Cold Ball ).
40. Armoring IX - Caster's skin and subcutaneous fat are changed into a more protective form, granting the caster a natural AT of 10.
50.  Corrupted  Form -  Caster  may  use  any  lower  level spell for this list once per round.

Note : Casting a Control Undead or Command Undead spell successfully (i.e., it is not resisted) will not turn the target hostile after the period of control is over.

The Control spells  (but  not Command spells)  on  this  list will also work on the mindless undead.

Liches of all types must be created by passing directly to undeath from life, without going through the process of dy -ing and cannot be created by means of this list. Individual GMs may choose to exclude certain other kinds of undead from this form of origin.

See Creature Law for more information on undead.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Undead Language - Allows the caster to understand and speak the language(s) of any undead beings.
2.  Tolerate  Undead -  Caster  is  not  subject  to  automatic harmful effects caused by the proximity of the undead. This provides no protection against deliberate attack.
3.  Sense  Undead -  Caster  becomes  aware  of  all  undead within the area of effect. He knows their general locations (within 10'), number, and general nature (whether corporeal or incorporeal, mindless or intelligent, controlled or uncon -trolled, and what Class of undead).
4. Control Undead I - Caster can control one Class I undead.  If  this  spell  is  resisted,  the  target  will  immediately attack  the  caster,  preferring  him  over  any  other  available targets.
5. Undead Defenses I - Caster has a +10 bonus to RRs and DB against attacks by the undead.

6. Create Undead I - Using a suitable corpse or spirit, the caster creates a Class I undead. Corpses must be a condition suitable for the type of undead to be created and in any case, the being to be converted into one of the undead may not have been dead any longer than one day per level of the cast -er. If the caster succeeds in a Hard Spell Mastery maneuver with an additional -10 penalty times the Class number of the undead created, then the caster may select what type of undead is created by this spell. If this maneuver fails, the GM selects an appropriate undead creature. Upon creation, the undead must make an RR against its creator. If it fails, it will be non-hostile to its creator until some circumstance (such as a failed attempt to Control it) should change things. If it succeeds, it is free to attack its maker if uncontrolled.

7. Command Undead I - Target undead will obey a com -mand by the caster for a period of one day. At the end of that time, the undead returns to its normal behavior. If this spell is resisted, the target will immediately attack the caster, pre -ferring him over any other available targets.

8. Control Undead II - As Control Undead I , except caster can control a Class II undead or control a Class I undead with a -10 to its RR.

9. Summon Lesser Spirit - This spell must be cast within 100' of the place of death of the being whose spirit is to be turned into an incorporeal form of undead. This spell will fail if the body is protected against being turned into one of the undead (e.g., under the protection of a Restful Spirit spell). The spirit summoned by this spell is suitable for cre -ating an undead being of up to Class III. A Create Undead spell must be successful before the end of this spell's dura -tion, or the spirit will depart once more. Spirit may not have been dead for more than 1 day/level of caster.

10. Create Undead II - As Create Undead I , except creates a Class II or lesser undead.

11. Undead Defenses II - Caster has a +20 bonus to RRs and DB against attacks by the undead.

12.  Control  Undead  III - As Control  Undead  I ,  except caster can control a Class III undead or control a Class II undead with a -10 to its RR or control a Class I undead with a -20 to its RR.

13. Command Undead II - As Command Undead I ,  ex -cept duration is 1 month.

14. Create Undead III - As Create Undead I , except cre -ates a Class III or lesser undead.

15. Summon Greater Spirit - As Summon Lesser Spirit , except the spirit summoned is suitable for the creation of undead of up to Class VI and may have been dead up to 1 week/level of caster.

16.  Control  Undead  IV - As Control  Undead  I ,  except caster can control a Class IV undead or control a Class III undead with a -10 to its RR or control a Class II undead with a -20 to its RR or control a Class I undead with a -30 to its RR.

17. Undead Defenses III - Caster has a +30 bonus to RRs and DB against attacks by the undead.

18. Command Undead III - As Command Undead I , ex -cept duration is 1 year.

19. Create Undead IV - As Create Undead I , except cre -ates a Class IV or lesser undead.

20.  Control  Undead  V -  As Control  Undead  I ,  except caster can control a Class V undead or control a Class IV undead with a -10 to its RR or control a Class III undead with a -20 to its RR or control a Class II undead with a -30 to its RR or control a Class I undead with a -40 to its RR.
25.  Control  Undead  VI - As Control  Undead  I ,  except caster can control a Class VI undead or control a Class V undead with a -10 to its RR or control a Class IV undead with a -20 to its RR or control a Class III undead with a -30 to its RR or control a Class II undead with a -40 to its RR or control a Class I undead with a -50 to its RR.
30. Create Undead V - As Create Undead I , except creates a Class V or lesser undead.
35. Control Undead True - Caster can control undead up to his level in total of the undeads' Class numbers. The RR of an undead may be reduced by -10 by assigning extra lev -els to its control up to a maximum penalty of -50. For ex -ample, a 38th level caster really wants to get control of the Class VI Greater Vampire leading the undead marauders, so he assigns an extra five levels on top of the six minimally required in order to create a -50 RR penalty. This leaves the caster with 27 levels left to assign to the control of other undead.
40. Create Undead VI - As Create Undead I , except cre -ates a Class VI or lesser undead.
50.  Undead  Mastery -  Places  target  undead  under  the caster's lasting control. The caster need but command the mastered undead, and it will obey to the best of its ability. Undead created by the caster get a -25 to their RRs. The caster can never have more levels of undead mastered than he has levels, although the undead mastered by means of the  Necromantic Ways list do not count against the limit mastered by this list and vice versa (i.e., a 60th level caster could have 60 levels of mindless undead mastered by means of Master Mindless Undead and  another 60 levels of un -dead mastered by means of Undead Mastery ).

Note :  Mindless  undead  are  any  undead  that  have  the  Mindless flaw.

Normally undead created by this list are Standard Created Undead, but other forms of mindless undead may be created with a suitable corpse (or spirit) and a successful Spell Mastery maneuver of Me -dium difficulty at a penalty of -10 per Class of the undead to be created. If this maneuver fails, the corpse turns to dust or the spirit vanishes beyond recall.

See Creature Law for more information on undead.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Animate Dead I - Caster can cause any dead body (within 50% of his own mass), to rise up and move. The caster must concentrate for the body to perform an action; if he stops concentrating, the body will stand motionless. The body can be maneuvered with a -25 modifier and can melee with a -20 OB. The body cannot have been dead more than 1 day. Use the stats from Creature Law for Class I Standard Created Undead except that the OB is -20 and it cannot move faster than a walk.

2. Control Mindless Undead I * - Caster can control one Class I mindless undead. When the caster does not concentrate, the un -dead will stay in place and attack only if a living target is within 10'.

3. Master Mindless Undead - [RR Mod.: -25] Caster may master 1 'Class' worth of mindless undead per level of the caster. This spell must be cast separately on each undead. The target undead must already be controlled by the caster and if the target resists this spell, it will attack the caster immediately and may not be subject to the caster's control again until the caster gains another level. A mastered undead allows the caster to control this specific undead without concentration (it will continue to follow the last order it was given).

4. Animate Dead II - As Animate Dead I , except caster can con -trol 2 bodies at once or one body with a -15 modifier to maneuvers and an OB of -10. Additionally, bodies may have been dead for up to 2 days.

5. Create Mindless Undead I - Given a body that has been dead less than 1 week, the caster can turn the body into a Class I undead. The newly-created undead will attempt to attack the closest living being (if uncontrolled), but can take no other activity than moving to  that  being  and attacking. If controlled, the undead will do as commanded by the controller.

6. Control Mindless Undead II * - As Control Mindless Undead I , except 1 Class II mindless undead or 2 Class I undead can be controlled.

7. Animate Dead III - As Animate Dead I , except caster can con -trol 3 bodies at once or one body with a -5 modifier to maneuvers and an OB of +0. Additionally, bodies may have been dead for up to 3 days.

8. Create Mindless Undead II - As Create Mindless Undead I, except 1 Class II undead or 2 Class I undead can be created.

9. Control Mindless Undead III * - As Control Mindless Undead I , except 1 Class III mindless undead or 1 Class II and 1 Class I undead or 3 Class I undead can be controlled.

10. Animate Dead IV - As Animate Dead I ,  except  caster  can control 4 bodies at once or one body with a +5 modifier to maneu -vers and an OB of +10. Additionally, bodies may have been dead for up to 4 days.

11. Create Mindless Undead III - As Create Mindless Undead I , except 1 Class III undead or 1 Class II and 1 Class I or 3 Class I undead can be created.

12. Animate Dead V - As Animate Dead I , except caster can con -trol 5 bodies at once or one body with a +10 modifier to maneuvers and an OB of +20. Additionally, bodies may have been dead for up to 5 days.

13. Control Mindless Undead IV * - As Control Mindless Undead I ,  except 1 Class IV mindless undead or 1 Class III and 1 Class I undead or 2 Class II undead or 1 Class II and 2 Class I undead or 4 Class I undead can be controlled.

14. Animate Dead VI - As Animate Dead I ,  except  caster  can control 6 bodies at once or one body with a +15 modifier to ma -neuvers and an OB of +30. Additionally, bodies may have been dead for up to 6 days.

15. Create Mindless Undead IV - As Create Mindless Undead I , except 1 Class IV undead or 1 Class III and 1 Class I or 2 Class II or 1 Class II and 2 Class I or 4 Class I undead can be created.

16. Control Mindless Undead V * - As Control Mindless Undead I ,  except  1  Class  V  mindless  undead  or  5  Class  I  undead or  any  other  combination  where  the  total  Class  numbers  of  the undead is five can be controlled.

17. Energize Corpse - Caster fills a corpse with extra Essence. If the corpse becomes an undead creature within the duration of the spell, its level is determined using the Level Spread Table (Table 3-2) in Creature Law normally, but with a bonus to the roll equal to the caster's ranks in this list. A caster may also cast this spell on himself prior to using Cheat Death - normally the conversion into a Lich results in a reduction in level, so every bit helps.

18. Create Mindless Undead V - As Create Mindless Undead I , except 1 Class V mindless undead or 5 Class I undead or any other combination where the total Class numbers of the undead is five can be created.

19. Control Mindless Undead VI * - As Control Mindless Undead I ,  except 1 Class VI mindless undead or 6 Class I undead or  any  other  combination  where  the  total  Class  numbers  of  the undead is six can be controlled.

20. Create Mindless Undead VI - As Create Mindless Undead I , except 1 Class VI mindless undead or 6 Class I undead or any other combination where the total Class numbers of the undead is six can be created.
25.  Mass  Mindless  Undead  Control  * - As Control  Mindless Undead I ,  except caster can control any group of undead whose Class numbers total no more than the caster's level.
30. Cheat Death - This spell is used only once, if ever. Using it, the caster transforms himself into a Lich, one of the most feared of the undead. If the caster fails when attempting this spell, he will simply die. With success, the caster becomes one of the undead without ever actually dying. At this point, the caster is sustained by magic and dwells in a place between life and death.
35. Army of the Dead - As Animate Dead VI , except the caster can raise as many bodies as he has levels or improve individual corpses as in the Animate Dead spells by assigning one level per number of the spell above one (e.g. a 37th level caster decides that the first corpse in his army will have +5 to maneuvers and an OB of +10 as in Animate Dead IV ; to do this he must assign one level for the corpse, plus three more for the improvement to Animate Dead IV quality, and has 33 levels left to assign to animating further dead). These corpses will remain animated for a full day, during which the caster can control the entire army whenever he concentrates. Additionally, corpses may be as old as one day dead per level of caster.
40. Army of the Dead True - As Create Mindless Undead VI , except  any  combination  where  the  total  Class  numbers  of  the undead is no more than the caster's level can be created. At the time the army is raised, the caster can give it an order that it will relentlessly follow for 1 day. At the end of that time, the undead will become uncontrolled and begin attacking the nearest living targets. Additionally, corpses may be as old as one day dead per level of caster.
50. Cheat Death True - As Cheat Death , except caster's organs are transferred into a ready container (jar, box, chest, etc.). The caster then becomes a somewhat more powerful Classic Lich and can only be truly destroyed if the container with his organs is de -stroyed.
