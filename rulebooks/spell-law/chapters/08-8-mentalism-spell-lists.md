1. Anticipate Attack * - Caster becomes aware of his pri -mary foe's likely attack. If the caster parries, the DB gained from the parry is doubled.
2. Anticipate Defense * - Caster becomes aware of his pri -mary foe's likely defense. If the foe parries, the DB gained from the parry is halved.
3.  Guess * - When faced with a choice about which the caster has little or no information (e.g., which corridor leads to  the  wine  cellar),  the  caster  may  cast  this  spell  and  the Gamemaster will determine which choice the caster actual -ly makes, biasing the choice favorably by 25% (e.g., if there are two choices, roll 1-100: correct on 26-100, incorrect on 01-25).
4. Anticipate Spell - Once this spell is cast, the next time that  the  caster  needs  to  cast  a  spell,  he  will  have  already subconsciously readied himself to do so. Treat the caster as having prepared that next spell for two rounds.
5. Intuitions I - Caster gains a vision of what will proba -bly happen in the next minute if the caster takes a specified action.
6. Anticipate Hostility - Caster is aware of any being with -in the range of the spell that has hostile intentions towards him. The hostility must be directed specifically at the caster or the spell reveals nothing. The being's hostility must be active (i.e., driving the being to perform aggressive actions), not passive (i.e., hate exists, but no action is planned).
7. Anticipate  Move -  Caster  has  a  second  sense  for  the coming actions of his competitor(s) in any game involving skill  (possibly  with  some  significant  element  of  chance, but  the  game  must  allow  meaningful  tactical  choices,  so games such as chess, go, poker, qualify; simply dicing for

the highest number would not), providing a +30 bonus to all maneuvers related to that game. Duration is one game or playing session. Does not apply to essentially solitaire games or gambling, regardless of degree of skill involved.

8. Dream I - Caster has a dream relating to a topic decid -ed upon just before retiring; limited to once per night. The caster must sleep for a normal sleep cycle (minimum of four hours) for this spell to work.
9. Room Feel I - Caster has a vision of what has occurred in a room or place; limited to up to 1 min/level into the past. The room must fit within a cube with edges equal to twice the caster's level in feet (i.e., if the caster is 9th level, then the room must fit inside an 18' x 18' x 18' cube).
10. Anticipations * -  Predicts  most  probable  action  of  a being in the next round; specifics are not learned (e.g., at -tack in melee, cast a spell; but no detail on attack target or what spell).
11. Intuitions II - As Intuitions I , except caster gets to gaze 2 minutes into the future.
12. Room Feel II - As Room Feel I , except limit is 1 hour/ level.
13.  Anticipate  Hostility  True -  As Anticipate  Hostility , except for area of effect, duration, and range.
14. Dream II - As Dream I , except limit is 2 dreams/night on different topics.
15. Spell Anticipation * - As Anticipations , except if ac -tion is to cast a spell, the spell to be cast and target(s) are learned.
16. Room Feel III - As Room Feel I , except limit is 1 day/ level.
17. Dream III - As Dream I , except limit is 3 dreams/night on different topics.
18. Anticipate Weather - Caster can predict with 95% ac -curacy the time, type, and severity of the weather to come over  the  next  seven  days  assuming  no  spells  or  magical phenomena interfere.
19. Room Feel IV - As Room Feel I , except limit is 1 week/ level.
20.  Intuitions  True - As Intuitions  I ,  except  caster  may gaze into the future for a number of minutes equal to the caster's level.
25. Anticipations True * - As Anticipations , except caster can predict actions of all beings within 100' of himself.
30. Dream V - As Dream I , except limit is 5 dreams/night on any combination of topics the caster chooses.
35. Dream True - As Dream V , except limit is one dream/ night per every five levels of the caster (i.e., a 35th level caster may have seven dreams).
40. Room Feel True - As Room Feel I , except there is no time limit.
50. Spell Anticipation True * - As Anticipations True , ex -cept spell types and targets are learned.

Note :  None of the 'Aura' spells ( Aura, True Aura, Mass Aura, and Alkar )  are  cumulative with each other or Blur . The Gamemaster may wish to allow the bonus from these spells to apply to Leadership as well as defense.

Certain spells on this list have a radius effect that can be cast upon mobile targets (e.g, Light, Darkness, Utterlight, Utterdark ). See Section 10.17 for more.

Consult RMCL Section 15.7 for dealing with light and dark -ness.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1.  Projected  Light -  Beam  of  light  (like  a  flashlight) springs from the caster's palm; it has a 50' effective range. If the caster's hand is closed into a fist, the light will 'turn off'.  If  the  caster's  fist  is  reopened  before  the  end  of  the duration, the light will turn on again.
2. Glow - Causes a small, 1" diameter point of light that will glow softly. This spell provides enough light for Night -vision to work properly, but not enough light to allow much mobility in the dark.
3. Light I - Lights a 10'R area about the point touched.
4. Aura - Causes a bright aura about the caster, providing a  more  powerful  appearance  and  subtracting  10  from  all attacks on the caster.
5. Light Eruption - [RR Mod: -10] Causes a 10'R sphere of intense light, all within are stunned (-50) for 1 round/10 failure.
6. Shock Bolt I - A bolt of intense, charged light is shot from the palm of the caster; results are determined on the Lightning Bolt attack table, as a Miniscule attack.
7. Darkness I - Reduces illumination to a dark night in a 10'R area about the point touched.
8. True Aura - As Aura , except it produces an extremely powerful appearance and subtracts 15 from all attacks.
9. Long Glow - As Glow , except for duration.
10. Light V - As Light I , except radius is 50'.
11. Darkness V - As Darkness I , except radius is 50'.
12. Shock Bolt III - As Shock Bolt I , but with a range in -crement of 75'.
13. Hue - Causes any object up to 1,000 cubic feet to glow with any desired color.
14. Mass Glow - As Glow , except produces one light per caster level and these can be directed by concentration any -where within 5' of the caster. Illumination will still be quite soft, but ten of them provide enough light to read by even without Nightvision.
15. Beacon V - Ray of light of any color springs from cast -er's hand, can be up to 5 miles long.
16.  Greater  Darkness - As Darkness I ,  except  radius  is 1000'.
17. Shock Bolt V - As Shock Bolt I , but with a range incre -ment of 125'.
18. Utterlight - Nullifies all magically created darkness in a 100'R, and lights that area as full daylight.
19. Utterdark - Darkens a 100'R area, no light (except Utterlight ) can exist within this radius.
20. Sunfires - Focuses sunlight as a lens, must be focused initially on a fixed point. The lens can be moved at a rate of 1'/round, after the first round. It will burn through a 1' diam -eter at a rate of: 1' wood/round, 4" stone/round, or 1" metal/ round. This spell cannot be used effectively in combat (as foes can easily move out of the way). However, if used on an immobile foe, see Hand of Fire for damage resolution.
25.  Sunfire  True - As Sunfires ,  except  does  not  require sunlight.
30. Hand of Fire - As Sunfires , except the initial focus is 6" from open palm of caster (caster's arm is immune) and it  can  be  moved 10'/round. If used in melee, it strikes on the Fire Bolt table (with concussion hits doubled) using the caster's Directed Spell: Elemental Bolts skill; concentration is not required when focus is fixed 6" from palm. If the at -tack is fumbled (01-02 UM), the caster takes an automatic C Heat Critical.
35. Rotating Beacon - As Beacon ,  except  that  the  beam will rotate through a full circle, repeatedly, and it has the listed  duration  and  stays  centered  at  the  initial  location, rather than requiring the caster to stay and concentrate.
40. Lightning Bolt III - A bolt of lightning is shot from the caster's palm; resolve attack on the Lightning Bolt Attack Table as a Medium-sized attack.
50. Hand of Fire True - As Hand of Fire , except does not require sunlight.

Note : Cloaking spells are not Invisibility spells and none of the normal rules for invisibility apply (e.g., the caster does not become 'visible' when he attacks or is hit, etc.).

Illusions  (such  as Façade,  Camouflage ,  and Shadow Mentalist )  are one of the more complex and subtle types of magic and they are ex -plained at length in Section 10.10. Cloaking is a form of 'mind trick' and is discussed in that same section.

  

1. Blur * - Causes caster to appear blurred to attackers, granting a +10 to the caster's DB.
2. Shadow - Caster and objects on the caster's person appear to be in shadow and thus are almost invisible in dark areas (in many situations this could be handled with a Stalking bonus of between +25 and +75).
3. Audio Cloak * - The next Cloaking spell cast by the caster of this spell, within a minute of completing this spell, will make any noises produced by the caster inaudible to the target(s). This means that the caster  can  then  speak  or  otherwise  make  a  sound  without  allowing additional RRs.
4. Cloaking I - [RR Mod = -50] Target makes an RR. Failure results in  the  caster  being  invisible  to  the  target;  others  see  the  caster  nor -mally. If the caster makes an obvious action (e.g., talking, moving an object, etc.), the target may make another RR (the GM may deem it ap -propriate to apply modifiers to this RR based upon the action the caster takes). If the caster attacks the target, the target may make another RR with a +50 modifier. If the caster begins to concentrate, he can extend the duration of this spell indefinitely (as long as he can concentrate).
5. Façade I - Caster has a limited illusion on himself that allows him to look like any humanoid race within 20% of his own size. The illu -sion moves as the caster moves.
6. Cloaking III - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I , except the caster can affect 3 targets.
7. Cloaking Sphere I - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I, except every target in the area of effect must make an RR. New targets entering the sphere while the spell is still in effect will need to make an RR or be affected as well. Once a target makes a successful RR, he need not make another RR against the spell; however, once affected, leaving the sphere does not cancel the effect.
8. Cloaking V - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I , except the caster can affect 5 targets.
9. Cloaking Sphere II - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking Sphere I , ex -cept for the area of effect.
10.  Shadow Mentalist I -  Creates  a  duplicate  of  the  caster;  if  the caster concentrates, it will move as willed; otherwise, it does exactly as the caster does. The duplicate must be created within line of sight of the caster and the caster can only control it within line of sight. If the caster concentrates, he can 'merge' the duplicate with himself and then split back apart again (making it difficult to discern which one is the 'real' caster).
11. Façade II - As Façade I , except illusion may include altering the caster's voice and any other sounds generated.
12. Cloaking X - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I , except the caster can affect 10 targets.
13. Cloaking Sphere III - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking Sphere I , except for the area of effect.
14.  Displacement  I -  Caster's  apparent  location  is  offset  from  the actual location; all attacks have no effect 10% of the time. Each time a foe misses due to this effect, the chance of that foe missing again goes down 5%.
15. Camouflage - Caster and objects on his person take on the visu -al  texture, color, and form of the surrounding area. Caster is nearly invisible when motionless (+200 to Stalking maneuvers) and gives a +50 bonus to Stalking attempts even when moving (requires concen -tration). This spell is not cumulative with Shadow .
16. Cloaking XX - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I , except the caster can affect 20 targets.
17. Extended Cloak III - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking III , except for duration.
18. Displacement II - As Displacement I , except chance of missing is 20%.
19.  Cloaking  Sphere V -  [RR  Mod  =  -50] As Cloaking  Sphere  I , except for the area of effect.
20. Shadow Mentalist II - As Shadow Mentalist I , except there are two duplicates.
25. Displacement III - As Displacement I , except chance of missing is 30%.
30. Camouflage True - As Camouflage , except does not require con -centration while moving and the Stalking bonus when moving is +75.
35. Extended Cloak VIII - [RR Mod = -50] As Extended Cloak III , except the caster can affect 8 targets.
40. Widespread Cloak - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I , except for duration and that the caster can make any number of associates (up to a maximum of the caster's level) invisible to the target. Additional RRs due to actions of one of these 'invisible' persons are resolved as for Cloaking spells, but if one of them is revealed to the target, this does not expose the others. (Only one RR is made initially to determine if the target resists having the entire group be invisible to him.)
50. True Cloaking - [RR Mod = -50] As Cloaking I , except the caster can affect as many targets as he has levels and the range is only limited to the caster's field of vision.

Note : When under the effects of an Unpain spell, there are no pen -alties for hits lost. Full effects of the lost hits occur when the spell duration ends. However, if the hits are healed before the duration ends, there is no effect. So, a character could be reduced to -38 hits while sustained by Unpain ,  but restored to 2 hits before the duration of the spell ended. He would never pass out. Likewise, if Unpain allows fighting beyond lethal hit loss, this has no effect until the spell expires.

  

1. Heat Resistance * - Caster is protected from natural heat up to 176°F (80°C) (treat as if caster were in 68°F [20°C] temperature). For temperatures above 176°F, subtract 108°F (60°C) to determine the effective temperature for the target. Caster also receives +20 to all RRs vs. heat spells/attacks and a +20 to DB vs. elemental fire/ heat attacks.
2. Cold Resistance * - Caster is protected from natural cold down to 14°F (-10°C) (treat as if caster were in 68°F [20°C] tempera -ture). For temperatures below 14°F, add 54°F (30°C) to determine the effective temperature for the target. Caster also receives +20 to all RRs vs. cold spells/attacks and a +20 to DB vs. elemental cold/ice attacks.
3. Light Resistance * - Caster is protected from natural light and light changes (instantly adjusting vision to changing light intensity to never be blinded by glare, sudden light, or sudden darkness).

4. Impact Resistance * - Caster is protected from falls of up to 50'. For falls longer than 50', subtract 50' to determine the effective length of the fall. Caster also receives +20 to all RRs vs. spells that do Impact criticals and +20 DB vs elemental attacks doing Impact criticals.

6. Stun Relief I * - Caster is relieved of 1 round's worth of accu -mulated stun effects.
7. Resist Poison * - Delays the effect of a poison on the caster. If the poison is not eliminated before the spell expires, the poison will affect the caster at that time.
8.  Heat Endurance - As Heat Resistance ,  except for duration, spell  is  not  instantaneous,  and  bonus  against  magical  attacks  is only +10.
9.  Cold Endurance - As Cold Resistance ,  except for duration, spell  is  not  instantaneous,  and  bonus  against  magical  attacks  is only +10.

13. Resist Blows * - Caster takes half hits damage from all phys -ical (non-magical) attacks.
14. Awake * - This spell will awaken the caster from sleep the round following casting (caster can preset conditions under which the spell will activate).

19. Light Resistance True * - As Light Resistance , except caster is  immune  to  natural  light/electricity  and  is  treated  as  one  Size larger when taking damage from electrical spells.
20. Unpain IV * - As Unpain I , except 100% additional hits may be sustained.
25. Neutralize Poison True * - As Neutralize Poison , except poi -son has a -70 modifier to its RR.
30. Awake True * - As Awake ,  except  there  is  no  delay  and  it can be triggered by any normally perceivable previously declared condition within 50' (e.g., anyone entering the area, a stranger en -tering the area, or a drawn weapon in the area).
35.  Elemental  Resistance  True  * -  As Heat  Resistance  True , Cold Resistance True , and Light Resistance True .
40.  Stun  Relief True  * -  Caster  is  relieved  of  all  accumulated stun effects.

Note : See Section 10.4 for more about detection spells.

  

1. Detect Mentalism - Detects any active spell or active magical item from the Mentalism realm; caster can concentrate on a differ -ent 5'R area each round.
2. Detect Essence - As Detect Mentalism , except realm is Essence.
3.  Detect  Channeling - As Detect  Mentalism ,  except  realm  is Channeling.
4. Determine Emotion - Caster can detect any extreme emotion (e.g., hatred, love, sadness, fear, etc.). In addition, the caster learns which emotion(s) the target is feeling. If there are no extremes of emotion (i.e.,  only  normal  feelings),  nothing  is  detected.  Caster may change the spell's target each round.
5. Detect Invisible - As Detect Mentalism , except detects invis -ible things; all attacks against something so detected are at -50.
6. Detect Evil - As Detect Mentalism , except detects any evil be -ing or any item created by evil or long used by a very evil person.
7.  Detect Traps - As Detect Mentalism ,  except  it  gives  a  75% chance of detecting a trap (modified by half the bonus or penalty difficulty of finding the trap through a Perception maneuver). See Section 10.14. If a trap is missed, the spell will not find it no matter how many times the caster scans the same area.
8. Determine Power I - Caster learns the power (level) of every person or item or spell within the area examined. Caster can focus on a different 5'R area each round.
9. Detect Substance - As Detect Mentalism , except it detects any one substance (e.g., gold, silver, black pepper, goat's milk, human blood, water) chosen by the caster at the time of casting.
10. Power Typing - Detects any active magic on a target person or item. It also analyzes general spell type (in item or cast) and what profession cast or created it; in case of a person, it gives an exact profession.
11. Determine Power II - As Determine Power I , except range is 100' and area is a circle with a 10' radius.
12. Detect Concealment - As Detect Mentalism , except detects anything deliberately concealed by non-magical means, including secret doors and compartments, as well as hiding individuals. To be detected, a thing must have either been hidden within 1 day/ level  of  the  caster,  or  there  must  be  someone  currently  within range who is aware of the concealment.
13. See Invisible - As Detect Invisible , except caster can see in -visible things anywhere the caster can normally see; the caster's attacks on invisible targets get no penalty (as they are not invisible to him).
14. Detect Intrusion - Caster learns if any external influences or probes are in the caster's own mind. The involved spell or effect is learned, but this spell does not reveal the identity of the 'intruder'.
15. Spell Probe - Detects any spell that has been cast in the area examined any time as far back as 1 day per caster level. For each spell, the caster learns the spell type and the list it was cast from. A different area may be probed each round.
16. Determine Power X - As Determine Power I , except range is 500' and area is a circle with a 50' radius.
17. Sense Problems - Each round, the caster can detect any poi -son, venom, disease, curse, parasitic infection, or mental illness afflicting  one  living  target,  gaining  a  general  knowledge  of  the type(s)  of  each  present  (e.g.,  a  Channeling  curse  and  two  mild nerve poisons).
18. Spell Typing - Detects and exactly identifies every spell cast or active in the target area. It will also identify any magic item or spellcaster within the radius as if it were a target of Power Typing .
19. See Invisible True - As See Invisible , except caster need not concentrate in order to see invisible things.
20. Determine Power True - As Determine Power I , except range is 1 mile and area is a circle with a 300' radius.
25. Location V - Gives the direction and distance to any specific object or place that the caster is familiar with or has had described in detail. The caster must have the dimensions of the object exact within 10% of actual size and know at least two other attributes that make the item unique (e.g., color, texture, weight, etc.) within range of the spell. Note that sometimes the caster must know more than two other attributes to make the item unique.
30. Detect True - Detects as any one of the lower level Detect spells. Thing detected and area of effect can both be changed each round.
35. Far Location - As Location V , except for range.
40. Spell Probe True - As Spell Probe , except detects spells as far back as one year per caster level.
50. Detection Mastery - Caster may use any of the lower level spells on this list up to level 30 each round. Also, the caster may combine 'detections', allowing the detection of multiple things in the same targeted area during a single round (once the appropriate spells are active).

Note : The wound healing spells on this list will treat all types of wounds except nerve and brain damage.

See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells (vari -ous Relief , Healing , and Healing True spells). While medical treat -ment of the wound is miraculously immediate, the body will still need a period of recovery before the injury has healed, depending on several factors, including which type of wound-healing spell is used.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Self Healing I - Caster is healed of 5 concussion hits damage.
2. Clotting I * - Allows caster to stop bleeding on a wound that is bleeding at rate of 1 hit/round. For one hour, the caster can engage in no activity more vigorous than walking or bleeding will resume at the prior rate.
3. Fatigue Relief - Removes up to -30 in penalties from fatigue.
4. Clotting III * - Allows caster to stop bleeding on a wound that is bleeding at rate of up to 3 hits/round. For one hour, the caster can engage in no activity more vigorous than walking or bleeding will resume at the prior rate.
5. Stun Relief I * - Caster is relieved of 1 round's worth of accu -mulated stun effects.
6. Light Wound Relief - An injury incurring a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine  maneuver  was  performed,  and  the  caster  receives  a +50 bonus on their recovery roll. Cuts (wounds that involve both bleeding  and  injury  penalties)  must  have  the  bleeding  stopped (e.g., with Clotting ) before the injury penalty may be treated (e.g., by this spell).
7.  Cut Repairs * - Instantly stops bleeding from 1 wound that bleeds at rate of 1 hit/round or permanently reduces bleeding from a more severe cut by 1 hit/round. This spell may be used repeated -ly on the same wound and the effects are cumulative.
8. Regeneration I * - Reduces damage by 2 hits every round as long as caster concentrates; if caster is unconscious, this spell will operate without concentration.
9.  Medium Wound Relief - As Light Wound Relie f,  except  an injury incurring a penalty up to  40.
10. Stun Relief III * - Caster is relieved of 3 rounds of accumu -lated stun effects.
11. Awake * - This spell will awaken the caster from sleep the round following casting (caster can preset conditions under which the spell will activate).
12. Severe Wound Relief - As Light Wound Relief , except an in -jury incurring any penalty.
13. End Coma - Caster comes out of a coma or unconsciousness caused by injury, disease, poison, spell, or spell failure.
14. Mass Clotting * - As Clotting I , except caster can heal bleed -ing in multiple wounds up to a total hits/round of bleeding equal to his level.
15. Self Keeping * - Upon receiving a death blow, the caster goes into a state of suspended animation, until cured or killed by brain destruction.
16. Cleanse Blood - This spell allows the caster to spend ten min -utes in renewing his body's blood. This allows him to gain a new RR with a +10 bonus to any blood-borne disease or poison which might be in his system. It will also stop any form of conversion process that entered through a wound (e.g., lycanthropy, vampir -ism). Caster remains automatically Concentrating throughout this process.
17. Joining * - Caster can reattach 1 severed limb. The recovery time is 1-10 days.
18.  Regeneration  III  * - As Regeneration  I ,  except  6  hits  are healed every round.
19. Restart Heart - Caster's heart will start beating after having stopped. This  does  not  repair  any  heart  disease  or  damage  that caused the initial stoppage.
20.  Stun  Relief V  * -  Caster  is  relieved  of  5  rounds'  worth  of accumulated stun effects.
25. Light Wound Healing - An injury incurring a penalty up to -20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a success -ful Medicine maneuver was performed, the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and the recovery period is reduced to hours rather than days.
30. Medium Wound Healing - As Light Wound Healing , except an injury incurring a penalty up to -40.
35. Severe Wound Healing -As Light Wound Healing , except an injury incurring any penalty.
40. Revitalization * - The caster instantly heals all concussion hit damage, hits/round damage, accumulated stun effects, and fatigue.
50. Regeneration True * - Caster can cast one lower level spell on this list each round, so long as he concentrates. He can also entirely  regenerate  body  parts:  a  muscle,  tendon,  or  bone  takes two rounds of concentration, while an organ other than the brain requires ten rounds of concentration, and a limb would take 1-10 hours, depending on how much is missing (10 hours for a full arm or leg). This does not allow regeneration of brain damage or nerve damage, except to grow new nerves in a regenerated limb. Concen -tration on this healing is not tiring and is maintained automatically.

<!-- image -->

  

1. Protection I - Caster gains a bonus of +5 to RRs against spells and a bonus of +5 to DB against elemental attacks.
2. Cancel Mentalism * - When the caster is a target of a spell from the Realm of Mentalism, the 'incoming' spell must first make an RR before the caster makes an RR. If the 'incoming' spell passes the RR, it may target the caster of this spell normally; otherwise the incoming spell has no effect on this target. Being a 'willing target' does not elim -inate this effect, but the caster's own spells do not need to make an RR. Note that the caster is considered to be a target of any spell which includes him in its area of effect or would 'detect' him.
3.  Mindwall -  Gives  the  caster  a  +10  RR  bonus  against spells with the 'mental' subtype.
4. Cancel Essence * - As Cancel Mentalism , except affects spells from the realm of Essence.
5. Protection II - As Protection I , except bonuses are +10.
6.  Cancel  Channeling * - As Cancel Mentalism ,  except affects spells from the realm of Channeling.
7. Cancel Two Realms * - As Cancel Mentalism ,  except affects spells from two realms of the caster's choice.
8. Mentalism Shield - Creates a shimmering shield in front of the caster: it provides a bonus to the caster's RR or DB of 10 against all frontal Mentalism spell attacks on the caster (force and elemental). If the caster takes an instantaneous action to do so, he can 'deflect' one spell attack. This re -sults in adding the caster's ranks in this list to his RR or, for

<!-- image -->

spells that use an attack table, to his DB (in addition to the basic bonus of 10 for having the Shield ). Multiple deflec -tions can be done in a single round, but each is a separate instantaneous action (costing 1 AP for every instantaneous action after the first).

9.  Cancel True * - As Cancel Mentalism ,  except  affects spells from any realm.
10. Essence Shield - As Mentalism Shield , except is effec -tive only against Essence spells.
11.  Protection  III - As Protection  I ,  except  bonuses  are +15.
12. Waiting Mentalism Cancel - As Cancel Mentalism , except this spell only attempts to cancel the next Mentalism spell (not cast by the caster) to target the caster. Only one Waiting Cancel can  be  in  place  at  a  time,  but  it  will  last indefinitely until triggered.
13.  Channeling Shield - As Mentalism Shield ,  except  is effective only against Channeling spells.
14. Waiting Essence Cancel - As Waiting Mentalism Cancel , except affects spells from the realm of Essence.
15. Spell Shield II - As Mentalism Shield , except it is effec -tive against any two of the three realms.
16. Waiting Channeling Cancel - As Waiting Mentalism Cancel , except affects spells from the realm of Channeling.
17. Protection V - As Protection I , except bonuses are +25.
18. Waiting Cancel True - As Waiting Mentalism Cancel , except affects spells from any realm.
19. Spell Shield True - As Mentalism Shield , except it is effective against all spells.
20. Mentalism Resistance - Gives a +50 to all RRs against Mentalism spells.
25. Essence Resistance - Gives a +50 to all RRs against Essence spells.
30.  Channeling  Resistance -  Gives  a  +50  to  all  RRs against Channeling spells.
35.  Layered  Defense -  Caster  may  make  a  second  RR against any spell, if the first RR fails.
40. Mirrored Spell Shield - As Spell Shield True , except if the caster makes a successful RR against the incoming spell while 'deflecting', he can send the spell back at the caster.
50. Resistance True - Gives a +50 to all RRs against all spells.

Note : When casting the Bladeturn/Deflections/Aim Untrue spells, the caster can concentrate in order to hold the spell until it can be applied to the allowed number of targets (See 'Delaying a Spell' in Section 4.8).

  

1. Turn Missile * - Caster adds +20 to his DB versus one missile fired at the caster. The caster must be able to see the attack.
2. Turn Blade * - Caster adds +20 to his DB versus one melee attack on the caster. The caster must be able to see the attack.
3. Shield * - Creates an invisible force shield in front of the caster; it subtracts 25 from up to 3 attacks per round from the caster's front. This does not occupy a hand, but is not usable with a physical shield (nor does it benefit from the Shield skill).
4. Turn Spell * - Caster adds +20 to his DB versus one directed spell attack on the caster. The caster must be able to see the attack.
5. Deflect I * - Deflects one missile fired at the caster; that missile has 50 subtracted from its attack (missile must be in caster's field of vision).
6. Bladeturn I * - As Deflect I , except its effect is against one melee attack.
7. Armor * - As Shield , except force shield encircles caster, protecting against any number of attacks from all directions. It can be combined with actual armor, but not with either a physical shield or the Shield spell.
8. Aiming Untrue I * - As Deflect I , except missile auto -matically misses.
9. Mighty Shield * - As Shield , but the defensive bonus is 40 against up to 4 attacks per round.
10.  Still Air  * -  Creates  a  pocket  of  still  air  1'/level  on all  sides  of  the  caster,  that  no  outside  gas  can  come  into (duration is the time for the oxygen to be exhausted by one person).
11. Deflect II * - As Deflect I , except affects 2 missiles.
12. Subconscious Reflex - Allows caster to get full Quickness-based DB against all attacks, including those of which the caster is unaware.
13. Spell Deflect I * - Deflects one directed elemental spell against caster; attack roll has -50 added to it (must be in field of vision).
14. Defensive Vibrations - Sets up vibrations in any weapon used to attack the caster in melee. This causes the fumble number of such weapons to be increased by 5.
15. Bladeturn II * - As Bladeturn I , except affects 2 melee attacks.
16. Enhanced Parry * - Caster's parry is doubled in value (i.e., if the caster used 15 OB to parry with, the caster would gain 30 DB).
17. Spell Evasion * - The caster moves to avoid the area of effect of an elemental area effect spell or innate power (typ -ically a ball attack or breath weapon). This results in a -50 to the attack roll as applied to the caster (and caster cannot be subjected to the attack bonus for being at the center of the attack).
18. Deflect III * - As Deflect I , except affects 3 missiles.
19. Aiming Untrue II * - As Aim Untrue I , except affects 2 missiles.
20. Spell Deflect II * - As Spell Deflect I , except affects 2 directed elemental attack spells.
25. Bladeturn III * - As Bladeturn I , except affects 3 me -lee attacks.
30. Spell Deflect III * - As Spell Deflect I , except affects 3 directed elemental attack spells.
35. Spell Deflect True * - As Spell Deflect I , except penalty to attacking spell is -100.
40. Enhanced Parry True * - As Enhanced Parry , except defensive value is tripled.
50. Deflect True * - As Deflect I , Bladeturn I ,  and Spell Deflect I ; except any 3 attacks can be deflected.

Note : All vacuums created by the spells on this list also cre -ate a loud noise. The larger the radius the louder the noise. The GM may wish to rule that all within the radius must make a second RR or be deafened for 1 round per 10 failure (RR attack level equals the radius of the vacuum).

An elemental creature made of gas will be reduced to 1 AP per round if successfully attacked with an Air Stop spell (the creature must fit into the area of effect). A Vacuum thrown at a creature made of gas will result in a Slaying IV Critical on the creature. A Whirling Winds has no effect on an elemental creature made of gas, though creatures shape-changed into gas are affected normally.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Condensation - Condenses 1 cubic foot of water from the  surrounding  air.  Condensation  can  be  channeled  into any suitable receptacle, including caster's cupped hands.
2. Warm Air - Warms 1 cubic foot per level of air (any inanimate gas) up to 100°F (56°C) above ambient tempera -ture.
3. Thick Fog I - Creates very dense fog in a 10' radius; normal visibility is 1'.
4.  Airwall -  Creates  a  wall  of  dense  churning  air  up  to 10'x10'x3'.  This  wall  requires  1 AP  to  cross,  the  pace  of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by one (e.g, a Run going in would be a Jog coming out), and attacks through the wall suffer a  -50  penalty.  See  Section  10.20  for  additional  details  on Wall spells.
5. Air Stop I - Stops all generalized air movement up to winds of 30 mph and cuts higher winds by 30 mph in a 10' radius.
6. Soft Vacuum I - Creates a near vacuum with a five foot radius; all within this radius take an A Impact critical, as air leaves and rushes back in.
7. Thick Fog V - Creates very dense fog in a 50' radius; normal visibility is 1'.
8. Unfog V - Disperses fog within the area of effect. If not all of a fog is dispersed (i.e., the fog covers a greater area than the area of effect for this spell), the fog will refill the area of effect, reducing the cleared radius by 10' every 1-5 minutes (varying depending on the heaviness of the fog and ambient humidity).
9. Curved Airwall - As Airwall , except wall is 10'x20'x3' and can be curved up to a semicircle.
10. Airwall True - As Airwall , except has a set duration of 1 min/level and does not require concentration.
11. Thick Fog X - Creates very dense fog in a 100' radius; normal visibility is 1'.
12. Air Stop V - As Air Stop I , except radius is 50'.
13. Unfog X - As Unfog V , except radius is 100'.
14. Soft Vacuum II - As Soft Vacuum I , except radius is 10'.
15. Gas/Air - All gas within 10' of caster is converted to breathable air.
16. Hard Vacuum I - As Soft Vacuum I , except it does a C Impact critical.
17. Whirling Winds - Creates a whirlwind about caster; it moves with the caster and has a 10'R. No missile attacks can penetrate it and any movement (except for caster's) into the whirlwind costs 2 AP and slows movement to a Walk pace, melee or elemental attacks on the caster through the whirlwind suffer a -50 penalty to OB.
18. Soft Vacuum IV - As Soft Vacuum I , except radius is 20'.
19. Constant Wind - Controls the wind within the radius of effect, from completely still air to up to 1 mph/level of wind in a constant direction.
20. Oxygenation - Enriches a 50' radius of air with extra oxygen; within this radius all animal life receives a +20 bo -nus to their OBs and fire attacks deliver double the normal number of hits.
25. Thick Fog True - As Thick Fog I , except duration is 1 hour/level and the radius is 100'/level.
30. Unfog True - As Unfog V , except radius is 100'/level.
35. Soft Vacuum VI - As Soft Vacuum I , except radius is 30'.
40. Hard Vacuum IV - As Hard Vacuum I , except radius is 20'.
50. Cloud Mastery - Caster has complete control of clouds within  area  of  effect  (includes  fog);  storm  clouds  can  be gathered and made to rain (or snow or hail in suitable con -ditions), but they cannot be created.

1. Boil Liquid - The caster may increase the temperature of any inanimate body of liquid of up to 1 cubic foot per level by 50°F (28°C) per round of concentration. Once the liquid begins to boil, it will not continue to heat up, but will begin to cool naturally if the caster stops concentrating. Caster is immune to the heat thus generated.
2. Freeze Liquid - The caster may decrease the temperature of any inanimate body of liquid of up to 1 cubic foot per level by 50°F [28°C] per round of concentration. Once the liquid freezes, it will not continue to grow colder, but will begin to warm naturally if the caster stops concentrating. Caster is immune to the cold thus generated.
3. Clear Liquid - Clears target liquid of all sediment.
4. Liquid Analysis - Gives nature and origin of natural liquid, and when and how a worked liquid was obtained and worked.
5. Desalination - Removes all dissolved substances from the tar -get liquid.
6. Waterwall -  Creates  a  wall  of  water  up  to  10'x10'x1'. This wall requires 2 AP to cross, the pace of anyone moving through it at more than a Walk comes out with his pace reduced by two (e.g, a Sprint going in would be a Jog pace coming out) to a minimum of a Walk, and attacks through the wall suffer a -80 penalty. See Section 10.20 for additional details on Wall spells.
7. Evaporation - As Boil Liquid , except all the liquid is evapo -rated (i.e., boiled away and turned into heated gas) at a rate of one cubic foot of liquid per round of concentration. Liquid and vapor are subject to natural cooling once caster ceases concentration.
8.  Liquid Corridor I - Creates a corridor through liquid up to 100' long, 3' wide, and 10' deep (must be open at the top).
9. Bolt of Water I - A bolt of water is shot from a water source within 20' of the caster; results are determined on the Water Bolt Table.  Range  modifier  is  based  on  the  distance  from  the  water source to the bolt's target.
10. Curved Waterwall - As Waterwall , except wall is 10'x20'x1' and can be curved up to a semicircle.
11. Calm Water - All water within a 100'R is calmed; waves are cut by 20' in the center and less towards the perimeter. This will negate the effects of currents in the area of effect.
12. Neutralize Acid - Transforms up to one cubic foot of acid per level to plain water.
13. Waterwall True - As Waterwall , but has a set duration of 1 minute/level and does not require concentration.
14. Dry Swimming - Caster can be exposed to liquid, even com -plete  submersion,  and  come  out  completely  dry,  protecting  his person  and  (probably  more  importantly)  his  possessions.  While this does not prevent drowning, any penalties for heavy clothing should  be  significantly  reduced,  as  they  will  not  become  wa -ter-logged and thus retain air and a certain degree of bouyancy.
15. Liquid Corridor III - As Liquid Corridor I , except limit is 300'x4'x50' deep.
16. Bolt of Water III - As Bolt of Water I , but range increment is 75'.
17. Lesser Whirlpool - Creates a whirlpool with a 20 foot radius in any liquid body that will draw in any objects in the liquid up to 200' away. Objects capable of moving under their own power may make a Very Hard maneuver to resist the pull of the whirlpool.
18. Wave - Creates a wave moving away from the caster; wave is 1' high/level in the center and 10'/level wide.
19. Water Bubble -  Creates  a  bubble  of  air  (10'R)  around  the caster and others, which will carry them in up to 100' depth of water (air is replenished). Caster can direct the motion of the bub -ble at a rate of 30'/round (may be adjusted by the presence of (un) favorable water currents). If/when the caster stops concentrating, the bubble will rise to the surface at the same rate (30'/round). If the caster resumes concentrating before the bubble surfaces, the bubble may be controlled again. All objects inside the bubble will rise with it. After reaching the surface, the bubble will burst.
20. Calm Water True - As Calm Water ,  except radius is 100'/ lvl and waves are cut by 50' in the center and caster need not con -centrate.
25. Liquid Corridor True - As Liquid Corridor , except limit is 100'/lvl x 6'x100' deep.
30. Superior Water Bubble - As Water Bubbl e, except radius is 20' and there is no depth limit.
35.  Waterspout -  Caster  creates  a  waterspout  over  a  body  of water  (minimally  1'  water  depth),  causing  it  to  arise  anywhere within range. The waterspout moves as the caster wills within the range of the spell (only a 10' radius may be effectively attacked each round, and a Spell Mastery roll may be required to attack an actively evasive target). Anything caught within the waterspout is subjected to a battering vortex of water (use the Water Bolt table with  a  +50  OB,  but  treat  the  attack  size  as  Large).  Waterspout takes one round to form.
40. Friendly Current - The area of effect for this spell is the wa -ter immediately surrounding the boat that the caster is on (where 'boat' should be interpreted loosely; a log is a 'boat' for purposes of this spell if the caster is riding it on water). For the duration of this spell, the speed of the boat will be modified by 25' per round (approximately 3 miles per hour) in a given direction (which may be 'upstream' or 'downstream' if following a river). One round of concentration will allow the caster to change the direction of this magical current.
50. Liquid Mastery - Caster can use one of the lower spells on this list each round, but with lesser ranges extended to 100'.

Note :  It  should  be  clear  from  the  spell  descriptions,  but experience with other game systems may lead to incorrect assumptions,  so  it  should  be  noted  that  it  is  not  possible for teleport error to place one inside a solid (or liquid, un -less one has intended to teleport into a liquid environment) object. The spell would then fail and the teleporting indi -vidual(s) suffer stun (-50) as explained in the description of Minor Long Door .

Spells  that  involve  teleportation  are  normally  quite  noisy and difficult to silence. Air is being pushed about in a man -ner not unlike a thunderclap. Amount of noise depends on the size of the object teleported.

  

1. Door Opening * - Opens a door. Any bars/bolts that the caster  can  see  will  be  displaced  to  allow  opening,  while locks (magical or mundane) have but a 10% chance of be -ing unlocked. See Section 10.14 for guidelines on handling locks.
2.  Leave  Item  I -  Caster  'teleports'  a  single  inanimate object to a point up to 100' away from its current location. There can be no intervening barriers in a direct line between the  target  and  the  point  (for  these  purposes,  a  barrier  is anything the object could not physically go through). The object has a maximum weight limit of 1 pound per level of the caster.
3. Minor Leaving - Caster 'teleports' to a point up to 50' away, but there can be no intervening barriers in a direct line  between  the  target  and  the  point  (for  these  purposes a  barrier  is  anything  the  caster  could  not  physically  go through; a closed door is a barrier, a pit is not).
4. Long Door Item I - As Leave Item I , except the object can pass through barriers by specifying exact direction and distance. If the arrival point coincides with solid material, the object does not move (though the caster still loses the PP).
5. Leaving I - As Minor Leaving , except caster can move 100'.
6. Mind Tongue I * - [RR Mod.: -50] Caster may mentally speak with any one thinking being. Caster must be able to see the target or the caster must know the exact location of the target. In all cases, the target must also be within range.
7. Long Door Item II - As Long Door Item I , except object can be moved up to 200'.
8. Leaving III - As Leaving I , except caster can move 300'.
9. Leave Item V - As Leave Item I ,  except object can be moved up to 500'.
10. Minor Long Door - As Minor Leaving , except caster can pass through barriers by specifying exact direction and distance. If the arrival point coincides with solid material, the caster does not move, instead being stunned (-50) 1-10 rounds, and the PP for this spell are still expended.
11. Leaving V - As Leaving I , except caster can move 500'. 12. Long Door I - As Minor Long Door , except caster can move 100'.
13. Long Door Item V - As Long Door Item I , except ob -ject can be moved up to 500'.
14. Mind Tongue III * - [RR Mod.: -50] As Mind Tongue I , except range is 1,000'.
15. Lord Leaving - As Leaving I , except caster can move 100'/level up to 2000'.
16.  Long  Door  III - As Long Door I ,  except  caster  can move 300'.
17. Heavy Long Door Item III - As Long Door Item I , except object may weigh up to 10 pounds/level and may be moved up to 300'.
18. Long Door V - As Long Door I , except caster can move 500'.
19. Mind Tongue IV * - [RR Mod.: -50] As Mind Tongue I , except range is 1 mile.
20. Mind's Door I - If caster has established mental contact with a target (an intelligent being) that will cooperate, the caster can teleport to the target's location or the target can teleport to the caster's location. There is no chance of error and the movement limit is 1 mile.
25. Leaving True - As Leaving I , except movement is lim -ited only by the barrier restriction (on a flat plain this would be the horizon).
30. Mind's Door II - As Mind's Door I , except limit is 10 miles/level.
35. Lord Long Door - As Long Door I , except caster can move 2000'.
40. Mind's Courier - As Mind's Door I , except that there is no distance limit and instead of being able to change their own locations, the caster may hand an item up to 1 pound/ level to the target, or the target may hand such an item to the caster.
50.  Mind's  Door  True - As Mind's  Door  I ,  except  that there is no distance limit.

Note :  The  'Presence'  ability  detects  minds  of  better  than animal  intelligence  (i.e.,  creatures  with  the  'Animalistic'  or 'Mindless' flaws are not detected). The caster will be aware of  proximity  to  within  10'  distance,  and  a  1 AP  action  will provide general direction (above, below, left, right, before, or behind) to one mind. If a detected mind belongs to a seen and recognized (as intelligent) being, then the caster will be able to identify the detected mind as belonging to that being.

See section 10.21 for a discussion of spells with 'Kind' in their name.

  

1. Spell Store - Caster may cast this spell with another spell in order to store that second spell. The spell to be stored must be cast within one minute after the Spell Store spell is cast. The stored spell may then be cast later as an instantaneous spell. The Spell Store spell costs the same number of PP as the spell that is stored. No other spell may be cast while a spell is stored.
2. Presence · * - Caster is aware of the presence of all sentient/ thinking beings within 20'.
3. Inner Wall I - Caster gets +5 bonus to RRs versus mind attacks.
4.  Efficient  Sleep -  Caster's  next  sleep  period  will  require 25% less time to complete, with the caster awaking as fully refreshed as if the complete normal time had been spent (e.g., if the caster normally required eight hours of sleep in a night, this spell would allow the caster to sleep only six hours instead).
5.  Recall -  Caster's  recall  of  relevant  past  experience  and education are enhanced to assist in the current situation; this increases the caster's Memory stat bonus by +25 for the du -ration of one maneuver involving Memory (e.g., the use of a 'lore' skill).
6. Misfeel Kind · * - For the purposes of mental or magical detections,  caster  appears  to  be  of  any  race  with  which  the caster is familiar.
7. Observation - Caster gains insight or facts by observing a person or thing with intense concentration (e.g., room, item); increases caster's Perception skill bonus by +50 for one 'ob -servation'.
8. Inner Wall II - Caster gets +10 bonus to RRs versus mind attacks.
9. Misfeel Calling · * - As Misfeel Kind , except caster's pro -fession may be misrepresented.
10. Correlation - Caster is able to correlate known facts to obtain conclusions; increases the caster's Reasoning stat bonus by +25 for the duration of one maneuver involving Reasoning (e.g., the use of a 'lore' skill, picking a lock, one 'navigation' attempt, etc.).
11. Misfeel Power · * - As Misfeel Kind , except caster's level may be misrepresented (to an upper limit of twice the caster's actual level).
12. Resolve - This spell enables the caster to have unusually intense focus and self-control for one situation or maneuver; increasing the caster's Self Discipline stat bonus by +25 for the duration of one maneuver involving Self Discipline (e.g., stalking a foe, a Perception maneuver, one 'silent kill' attempt, etc.).
13. Inner Wall III - Caster gets +15 bonus to RRs versus mind attacks.
14.  Pseudoconcentration  * -  This  spell  assigns  a  compart -mentalized portion of the caster's mind to maintain a spell with a duration of 'C'. Effectively, it allows that part of the caster's mind to concentrate on the spell, freeing the rest of the caster's mind to do other things (i.e., the caster does not take the nor -mal penalty for Concentration). The caster can have only one Pseudoconcentration active at one time.
15.  Unpresence  Self ·  * -  Target  becomes  undetectable  by Presence spells or related abilities.
16. Inner Wall V - Caster gets +25 bonus to RRs versus mind attacks.
17. Total Recall - As Recall , except recall is nearly automatic and in effect gives the caster an eidetic memory; Memory bo -nus is +50.

20. Observation True - As Observation , except virtually ev -ery detail in even a large situation is noticed; Perception bonus is +100.
25. Correlation True - As Correlation , except obtaining con -clusions is nearly automatic; the Reasoning bonus is +50.
30. Resolve True - As Resolve , except focus/control is nearly total; the Self Discipline bonus is +50.
35. Outer Wall - As Inner Wall True , except protects not only the  caster,  but  anyone  with  whom  the  caster  is  in  telepathic contact.
40. Misfeel True - As Misfeel , except it has a ten minute/level duration and does not require concentration.
50. Mirrormind - Caster reflects all mind attacks back on the attacker who must then make an RR against his own spell.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1.  Sly  Ears -  Caster  gains  an  extremely  acute  sense  of hearing. This  results  in  +50  to  Perception  rolls  involving only hearing, +25 to Perception involving hearing and other senses.
2. Nightvision - Caster can see up to 100' as if it were day -light, so long as there is some light.
3. Sidevision - Caster has a 300° field of vision. The flank bonus for attacks against the caster is lowered to +5 and the rear bonus is lowered to +15.
4. Detect Illusion - Caster can check one object or place (up to a 5'R) and tell if it is an illusion or has an illusion on it.
5. Watervision - Caster can see 100' in any water (includ -ing murky water) as if through air in daylight.
6. Scent - Caster gains an extremely acute sense of smell (e.g., +50 to Perception involving only smell, +25 to Per -ception involving smell and other senses).
7. Fogvision - As Nightvision , plus caster sees 100' in any precipitation (including thick fog) as if the air were clear.
8.  Touch -  Caster  gains  extreme  tactile  sensitivity.  This provides a bonus to any action requiring a sense of touch. For  example,  caster  might  receive  +25  to  picking  locks, disarming traps, opening secret doors, etc. and +50 to Per -ception involving only touch, +25 to Perception involving touch and other senses).
9. Darkvision - As Nightvision , except any darkness can be seen through. No light at all is needed for this spell to work.
10. Mentalist Ear - Caster can pick a point up to 100'/ level away and hear as if at that point (there can be intervening objects such as walls); the caster must have visited the point before or have the location in sight. Note that this means that the caster does not have hearing at his own location.
11. Mentalist Eye - As Mentalist Ear , except caster can see instead of listening.
12. Disillusion I - While this spell is in effect, one illusion within the caster's range ceases to exist for the caster only. The caster must specify the illusion to be negated (unless caster knows something is an illusion, this spell would be gambling PP).
13. Detect Illusion True - As Detect Illusion , except caster can concentrate on one object or place per round.
14. Multivision - As all lower level Vision spells functioning at the same time.
15. Nightvision True - As Nightvision , except range is the normal daylight vision range.

17. Disillusion True - As Disillusion ,  except all illusions within range cease to exist for the caster.
18. Watervision True - As Watervision , except range is the normal daylight vision range.
19.  Fogvision  True - As Fogvision ,  except  range  is  the normal daylight vision range.

35. Mentalist Senses True - As Mentalist Senses ,  except range is 1 mile/level.
40. Microvision - Caster can view objects within 2' at up to 40x magnification.
50. Sensory Merge - Caster can 'merge' senses with those of a subject whose location is known by spells or by prior arrangement. Both caster and target will have a full aware -ness of both locations; the spell provides for this not being terribly confusing. If target is not at the specified location, the PP for this spell are wasted.

  

1. Balance * - Adds +50 to any rolls for any moving ma -neuvers performed at a walking pace or less (e.g., walking a 3' beam).
2. Contraction - Allows caster to disjoint limbs, contract muscles, etc.; in order to escape manacles and ropes and slip through small places (+50 to +100 to escape maneuvers).
3.  Face  Shifting -  Alters  the  caster's  face  to  resemble someone else, but not so closely as to be confused on a close inspection.
4. Change Lore - Allows caster to analyze the form of an -other being for future use with True Change . The caster can only have as many forms analyzed as he has ranks in this list. Caster may choose to forget a form at any time to make room for replacements.
5. Waterlungs - Caster can breathe water but not air.
6.  Rubberform -  Alters  the  caster's  flesh  and  bones  to a  more  elastic  form,  reducing  by  one  the  severity  of  all 'Krush' and 'Impact' criticals taken.
7. Changing To Kind - Alters the caster's entire body to the form of another humanoid race. The form cannot be that of a particular individual form. For example, a human caster could take the form of a Dwarf, but not the Dwarven High Chancellor. Only the physical form is gained (e.g., a target who becomes a Dwarf would not receive the Dwarves' abil -ity to see in the dark). This spell does not allow the caster to  change  his  Size  category,  but  size  may  be  changed  as desired within that limit. This does not change anything the caster carries or wears, only his own body, except that pros -

thetics added by the Lay Healer Base list Prosthetics will change with the caster.

8. Gaslungs - Caster can breathe any gas as normal air.
9. Depth Mastery - Caster's body is able to adapt to extremely high or low pressure or sudden changes in pressure, without suffering any harm. This does not apply to crushing by solids, only pressures from environmental gasses or liq -uids.
10. Greater Face Shifting - As Face Shifting , except du -ration is 1 hour/level.
11. Changing Lungs - Caster can breathe water, air, and any gas at will.
12. Size Change - Alters the caster's Size by one category. This does not change anything the caster carries or wears, only his own body, except that prosthetics added by the Lay Healer Base list Prosthetics will change with the caster.
13. Change - As Changing to Kind , except alteration can be to any organic form within the caster's own Size catego -ry; caster does not obtain any special abilities.
14. Water Breather - As Waterlungs ,  except  duration  is one hour/level.
15. Solid Form - Caster becomes as if made of very dense stone (cannot move or cast spells).
16. No Lungs - Caster does not need to breathe at all.
17. True Change - As Change , except altered form can be that of a specific being analyzed by Change Lore .
18. Changing - As True Change , except caster may assume a different form anytime during the spell; each change of shape takes one round of concentration.
19. Sea Dweller - As Waterlungs plus Depth Mastery , ex -cept duration is one hour/level.
20. Waterform - Caster takes the form of a liquid mass, able to seep through cracks as well as water. In this form, the caster can move through water at 10 mph, but is unable to cast spells.
25.  Mistform -  Caster  takes  the  form  of  a  mist,  able  to fly  20  mph (modified by ambient winds, of course), seep through cracks,  extend  self  to  become  virtually  invisible, etc. (may not cast spells in this form).
30.  Form  Master - As Waterform and Mistform ,  except the two forms are interchangeable at will (concentrate for 1 round to change).
35. Waterform True - As Waterform ,  but caster can cast spells with a -10 penalty.
40. Mistform True - As Mistform , but caster can cast spells with a -10 penalty.
50. Change Master - As Changing and Form Master , ex -cept all forms are interchangeable at will (concentrate for 1 round to change). The caster's Size may be changed by one category.

1.  Instant  Stance * -  Caster  can  change  stance  instanta -neously  at  any  time  during  the  spell  duration.  Stance  is standing, sitting, crouching, prone, etc.
2. Instant (Dis)Mount * -  Caster mounts or dismounts a riding beast 'instantly' (i.e., the action is considered part of this instantaneous spell action for 0 or 1 AP).
3. Instant Awareness * - Caster makes a Perception maneuver at no penalty to assess the current situation instantly (i.e.,  the  Perception  maneuver  is  considered  part  of  this instantaneous spell action for 0 or 1 AP).
4. Swiftness I - Caster gains a +5 bonus to initiative rolls.
5.  Rush  I -  Caster  gains  an  additional  1 AP  to  use  each round  this  spell  is  in  effect  (i.e.,  caster  gets  5 AP  to  use during the round), and he may maintain the spell so long as he wishes. However, caster incurs a -2 fatigue penalty at the end of each round (adding to any existing penalty including from previous rounds). It is not possible to rest while this spell remains in effect.
6. Long Stride I - Caster has a 10% increase in his base movement  rate  (BMR),  rounding  up  to  the  nearest  foot/ round. For a BMR of 20'/round, this results in a 2'/round increase.
7.  Haste I - Caster gains an additional 1 AP to use each round  this  spell  is  in  effect  (i.e.,  caster  gets  5 AP  to  use during the round).
8. Swiftness II - Caster gains a +10 bonus to initiative rolls.
9.  Lightning  Reflexes  * -  When  he  would  otherwise  be surprised, the caster's subconscious casts this spell and this negates surprise effects.
10. Swiftness III - Caster gains a +15 bonus to initiative rolls.
11. Rush II - As Rush I , except caster gains an additional 2 AP.
12. Long Stride III - As Long Stride I, except increase is 30%.
13. Swiftness IV - Caster gains a +20 bonus to initiative rolls.
14. Lightning Thought * - Caster's mind works at incredible speed, allowing time to carefully consider the situation as  if  the  world  paused  while  he  makes  up  his  mind.  No physical action may be taken in this moment, nor may any spells be cast, but much mental activity may be done. In ad -dition to being able to take time to consider when otherwise faced  with  a  need  for  an  instant  decision,  the  character's Lore and Science skills (and the knowledge aspects of other skills) may be used to make maneuvers (although no skill may be consulted more than three times). If the caster is in mental contact with someone, he may send a message of any length, though the recipient will need the normal time to process it. Anything mental sensed may be examined as carefully as might be done in a full round.
15. Haste II - As Haste I , except caster gains an additional 2 AP.
16. Flash Magic - While this spell is active, the caster casts all spells as instantaneous spells.
17. Rush III - As Rush I , except caster gains an additional 3 AP.
18. Quickness - Caster's Quickness bonus is increased by +5.
19. Power Nap - Allows caster to complete an entire sleep cycle in one hour (allows quick PP and hit recovery).
20. Long Stride V - As Long Stride I ,  except increase is 50%.
25. Haste III - As Haste I , except caster gains an additional 3 AP.
30. Rush IV - As Rush I , except caster gains an additional 4 AP.
35. Rush V - As Rush I , except caster gains an additional 5 AP.
40.  Quickness  True -  Caster's  Quickness  bonus  is  increased by +15.
50. Haste IV - As Haste I , except caster gains an additional 4 AP.

See RMCL Section 13.1.

See  Section  10.9  for  the  application  of  wound-healing  spells (various Relief, Healing, and Healing True spells). While medical treatment of the wound is miraculously immediate, the body will still  need  a  period  of  recovery before the injury has healed, de -pending on several factors, including which type of wound-heal -ing spell is used.

In no case do these spells allow the disease or poison removed to make an RR.

Parasitic infestation is considered a disease for purposes of this list.

  

1. Flowstop III * - Reduces target's blood loss by up to 3 hits per round. Until the injury is actually treated by some means (e.g., Medicine  maneuver  or  a Flesh  Relief spell),  the  target  cannot move or be moved without the bleeding resuming. Multiple Flowstop spells may not be cast upon the same wound.
2. Cut Repair I * - Instantly stops bleeding from a wound that bleeds at a rate of 1 hit/round.
3. Poison/Disease Relief - One poison or disease afflicting the target is reduced by one level of severity (e.g. from Extreme to Severe, or from Mild to cured), and, in the case of disease, anyone subsequently infected by the target gains a bonus of +20 on their RR. This spell may not be used multiple times on the same target to treat the same disease.
4. Clotting III * - Stops bleeding on a wound bleeding up to 3 hits/round. For one hour, the target can engage in activity no more vigorous than walking or bleeding will resume.
5. Cut Repair III * - Instantly stops bleeding on a wound that bleeds at a rate up to 3 hits/round.
6. Severe Flesh Relief - A flesh wound or skin/tissue injury or any severity is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a  successful  Medicine  maneuver  was  performed,  and  the  target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll. Note that this treats wounds that incur injury penalties, but does not treat bleeding.
7. Poison/Disease Resistance - Target receives an additional RR vs either poison or disease, as specified by the caster at the time of casting.
8. Medium Flesh Healing - A flesh wound or skin/tissue injury that incurs a penalty up to -40 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and the re -covery period is reduced to hours rather than days.
9. Joining ‡ * - Caster may reattach one severed limb. The Joining spells from the Bone, Muscle, and Nerve and Organ Mastery spell lists must be cast for the limb to be functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.

10. Flowstop True * - As Flowstop III ,  except the caster may stop all blood loss in the target.

11. Suspend Life I ‡ * - Target is kept in a state of suspended animation and prevented from dying for the duration of the spell (i.e.,  the  body  is  'preserved'  and  the  'soul'  will  not  leave  the body). Also requires the use of the other Suspend Life I spell (on the Nerve and Organ list).
12. Clotting True * - As Clotting III , except a wound bleeding at any rate.
13. Cut Repair V * - Instantly stops bleeding on a wound that bleeds at a rate up to 5 hits/round.
14. Undisease - Removes any one disease from the target.
15. Cut Repair True * - Instantly stops bleeding on a wound that bleeds at any rate.
16. Severe Flesh Healing - As Medium Flesh Healing , except a wound incurring any penalty.
17. Suspend Life II ‡ * -  As Suspend Life I , except for dura -tion and the requirement of Suspend Life II from Nerve &amp; Organ Mastery.
18. Unpoison - Removes any one poison from the target.
19.  Multitarget  Clotting - As Clotting  III ,  except  stops  total bleeding of up to 1 hit/round per level of the caster in any number of targets within range.
20. Joining True ‡ * - As Joining , except recovery is instanta -neous.
25. Mass Cut Repair - Caster can instantly stop bleeding from multiple  wounds  (in  a  single  target)  up  to  a  total  hits/round  of bleeding equal to his level.
30.  Light  Flesh  Healing True - A flesh wound or skin/tissue injury that  incurs  a  penalty  up  to  -20  is  cleaned,  protected,  and bound as effectively  as  if  a  successful  Medicine  maneuver  was performed, the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and the recovery period is reduced to rounds rather than days.
35. Medium Flesh Healing True - As Light Flesh Healing True , except an injury incurring a penalty up to  40.
40. Severe Flesh Healing True - As Light Flesh Healing True , except an injury with any penalty.
50. Regrow Limb ‡ * - Caster can regrow 1 severed limb; it re -quires the use of the Regrow Limb spells from Bone, Muscle, and Nerve and Organ Mastery for the limb to become fully functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.

Note : See Section 10.9 for the application of wound-healing spells (various Relief , Healing ,  and Healing True spells). While medical treatment of the wound is miraculously immediate, the body will still need a period of recovery before the injury has healed, depend -ing on several factors, including which type of wound-healing spell is used.

  

1. Diagnosis - Diagnoses target's wounds, injuries, and diseases allowing a +20 bonus to all Medicine maneuvers made by the caster to treat the target's diagnosed condition(s). Caster can take a round to advise someone else on treating the target, providing a +10 bonus to treat the target.
2. Light Organ Relief - An injury to an organ (e.g. eye, ear, liver but not the brain or nerves) incurring a penalty up to  20 is cleaned, protected, and bound as effectively as if a successful Medicine ma -neuver was performed, and the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll.
3. Medium Organ Relief - As Light Organ Relief , but an injury incurring a penalty up to -40. This can be used to cure most causes of infertility (if the requisite organs are still present).
4. Organ Preservation * - Prevents deteriorization of any specific organ, even if it is outside of its body.
5.  Restart Heart - Target's heart will start beating after having stopped.  This  does  not  repair  any  heart  disease  or  damage  that caused the initial stoppage.
6. Sense Enhancement - One of target's natural senses (e.g. vision, hearing, touch) is honed and perfected for the duration. Perception maneuvers based exclusively on that sense gain a +20 bonus, while Perception that involves that sense and others gain a +10 bonus.
7.  Severe  Organ  Relief - As Light  Organ  Relief ,  but  an  injury incurring any penalty.
8. Coma Recovery - Target comes out of a coma or unconscious -ness caused by injury, disease, poison, spell, or spell failure. Process takes 1-10 hours and target is at -50 to Endurance rolls for 1-10 days.
9. Joining ‡ * - Caster may reattach one severed limb. The Joining spells from the Bone, Blood, and Muscle Mastery spell lists must be cast for the limb to be functional. The recovery time is 1-10 days.
10. Distortions - Target experiences all sense impressions as dis -torted and confused. Target is at -25 for most actions, suffers double penalties if attempting to move faster than a walk, and has a -40 to Perception rolls.
11.  Suspend Life I ‡ * - Target is kept in a state of suspended animation and prevented from dying for the duration of the spell (i.e., the body is 'preserved' and the 'soul' will not leave the body). Also requires the use of the other Suspend Life I spell (on the Blood Mastery list).
12. Medium Organ/Nerve Healing - An injury to an organ, brain, or nerves incurring a penalty up to -40 is treated as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, the target receives +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
13.  Organ  Transplant - Allows  caster  to  transplant  a  healthy organ (not including brain or nervous system) into the target. Re -quires a one-hour operation. Recovery time is 1-10 days. Chance of rejection is 1% if organ comes from a relative of the target, 10% if it comes from a member of the same species, 30% if it comes from a similar species (e.g., one humanoid to another), and 60% if it comes from a vaguely similar species (e.g., ape to humanoid).

14. Severe Organ Healing - As Severe Organ Relief , except the recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.

15. Sense Impairment - Target's senses are impaired. All Percep -tion maneuvers are at -40 and target cannot sense anything further than 20' away.
16. Paralysis Cures - Caster can cure any paralysis problem. The recovery time is 1-10 days. Treat as a -100 injury for progress of recovery.
17. Suspend Life II ‡ * -  As Suspend Life I , except for duration and the requirement of Suspend Life II from Blood Mastery.
18. Rapid Organ Transplant - As Organ Transplant , except re -covery time is only 1-10 hours.
19. Severe Nerve Healing - An injury to the brain or nerves incur -ring any penalty is treated as effectively as if a successful Medicine maneuver was performed, the target receives a +50 bonus on their recovery roll, and the recovery time is reduced to hours rather than days.
20.  Joining True ‡ * - As Joining ,  except  recovery  is  instanta -neous.
25. Nerve/Organ Regeneration - Target will regenerate any one organ  (external  or  internal)  or  the  brain  or  nerves.  The  recovery time is 1-10 hours for most organs or 1-10 days for the brain, during which the target is unconscious. This spell will restore memories and knowledge which might otherwise have been lost due to brain damage.
30. Severe Nerve Healing True - As Severe Nerve Healing , ex -cept the recovery time is reduced to rounds.
35. Brain Transplant - As Organ Transplant , except a brain may be transplanted and the chance of rejection becomes a chance of the brain going insane because it cannot adapt to its new body.
40.  Regrow Limb ‡ * - Caster can regrow one severed limb; it requires  the  use  of  the Regrow Limb spells  for  Bone,  Blood,  and Muscle Mastery for the limb to become fully functional. The recov -ery time is 1-10 days.
50. Rapid Brain Regeneration - As Nerve/Organ Regeneration , except the recovery time for brain regeneration is 1-10 hours.

Note : Any attempts to dispel an Animation spell are done at a -50 penalty.

As used here, a 'prosthetic' is an artificial body part formed and (potentially) animated by magic. This usage is distinct from real world artificial limbs, properly called 'protheses' (sing., 'prothe -sis'), the art of their creation being 'prosthetics'. In mixed science and magic settings, Lay-Healer-created prosthetics and technolog -ical protheses may both be in use.

  

1. Measurements - Caster learns the proper dimension needed to make a false limb or other prosthetic for the target.
2. Fashion Wood - Allows the caster to create a perfectly formed artificial limb (or other body part) out of non-magical wood. This takes 8 hours. Suitability for use is guaranteed by this spell. Any special features or enhanced appearance depends on the appropri -ate Crafting skill(s) of the caster. Requires that Measurements has been cast to determine necessary form of the prosthetic.
3. Fit Wood - Allows caster to attach an artifical wooden limb or other prosthetic to a body. Process takes 1 hour. This spell must be cast before an Animation spell can be cast.
4. Animation I - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 8 hours.
5. Fashion Glass - As Fashion Wood , except the material worked is  non-magical  glass,  and  it  requires  two  castings  (16  hours  of work) to finish the prosthetic.
6. Fit Glass - As Fit Wood ; except allows caster to attach a glass prosthetic.
7. Animation II - Allows  target  to  operate  any  artificial  limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 24 hours.
8. Fashion Metal - As Fashion Wood , except the material worked is metal, and it requires three castings (24 hours of work) to finish the prosthetic.
9. Fit Metal - As Fit Wood ; allows caster to attach a metal pros -thetic.
10. Artificial Flesh - This spell enables the caster to convert clay into artificial flesh which can be used to cover an artificial limb (which  must  be  done  at  the  time  of  casting).  The  flesh  is  only semi-realistic  (similar  to  plastic).  Time  required  to  cover  a  full limb is 4 hours if the limb is for a Small recipient, 8 hours for a Medium limb, and 16 hours for a Big limb. If the prosthetic is not a full limb (e.g., a hand or foot), the GM should decrease the time.
11. Animation III - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 1 week.
12.  Fashion  Special -  As Fashion  Wood ,  except  the  material worked may be of any type, including magical materials, and it requires four castings (32 hours of work) to finish the prosthetic.
13. Fit Special - As Fit Wood ; allows caster to attach a 'special' (of enchanted or exotic material) prosthetic.
14.  Mechanical Contrivance - Allows incorporation of simple mechanisms into a prosthetic (e.g., a small retractable knife blade hidden in a finger), which can then be operated by the will of the wearer when an Animation spell is active on the prosthetic. The mechanism must be constructed normally.
15. Animation IV - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 1 month.
16. Repair Prosthetic - Repairs all damage to a single prosthetic.
17. Artificial Organ - Allows an artificial organ (created with one of the Mold spells on this list and/or through normal crafting) to be incorporated into a living target. Typically, this will be a glass eye that can provide sight when an Animation spell is cast on it, but theoretically any organ could be replaced with a suitable artificial organ. If an internal organ is replaced, surgery will be required for the insertion of the artificial organ.
18.  Mechanical  Contrivance  True -  As Mechanical  Contrivance , except that a complex mechanism (e.g., a dart gun) can be included in a prosthetic.
19. Animation V - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 3 months.
20. Artificial Flesh True - As Artificial Flesh ,  except perfectly realistic synthetic flesh can be made and worked. The process will require days instead of hours, with the same numbers as in Artificial Flesh .
25. Animation VI - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 1 year.
30. Animation VII - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will for 1 decade.
35. Implant Spell - Caster can emplace one spell of any level into a prosthetic. Within one minute of casting this spell, the spell to be emplaced must also be cast (within 10'). Once the spell is im -planted, it will remain waiting in the prosthetic until used. When the prosthetic is attached and an Animation spell is in effect, the prosthetic  wearer  may  trigger  the  spell  at  any  time  (treat  as  an innate power).
40. Prosthetic Addition - This spell allows the caster to attach an artificial part that is not a replacement. The recipient of the part could be given wings (two spells and two prosthetics required to actually fly), an extra arm, or the like. An Animation spell is required for the added part to actually function.
50. Animation True - Allows target to operate any artificial limbs (and other prosthetics) at will permanently.

Note :  Illusions (such as Concealed Object )  are  one of the more complex  and  subtle  types  of  magic  and  they  are  explained  at length in Section 10.10.

  

1. Concealed Object I - Target object (no larger than a dagger) is camouflaged to appear as part of the caster's clothing or skin. This is an illusion to all senses (including feel), and can be detected as an illusion. The object will remain concealed until taken from the location, or the duration expires.
2. Study Patsy - [RR Mod: -50] When this spell is cast on a per -son, it remains active for 24 hours. After 24 hours has passed (but before another 24 hours has passed), the caster must cast this spell again on the same person. During the time the spell is active, it is  recording  information  concerning  the  activities  of  the  target. When  the  spell  is  cast  the  second  time,  the  information  about those activities is revealed to the caster. This information is used for spells later on this list and spells on other lists (see the Misdi -rections and Disguise Mastery lists). The caster can only have one 'patsy' studied at a time.
3.  Well-Aimed Attack  I -  The  next  attack  made  by  the  caster (within one minute of casting this spell) receives a bonus of +25.
4. Open Ambush I - If the caster's next attack (made within one minute of casting this spell), gets a 'flank' or 'rear' bonus, he may use his Ambush skill even if the target is aware of the caster. How -ever, the maximum change to the critical roll from Ambush is ±2.
5.  Improvised Attack  I  * -  The  caster  is  able  to  make  use  of whatever weapons are available, including non-standard weapons such as a candlestick. Whatever penalties are applied due to the use of 'similar skill', limitations of the item when employed as a  weapon,  or  unsuitability  for  use  due  a  mismatch  between  the caster and the user for which a weapon is designed (as from Size) are reduced by 20.
6. Create Evidence I - Caster may cast this spell to create one piece  of  physical  evidence  that  implicates  the  currently  studied patsy (see Study Patsy ). This could include a fingerprint, a foot -print, etc., but must be something that cannot normally be moved from the crime scene. The evidence should be treated as circum -stantial (i.e., a good alibi should still get the patsy off the hook).
7. Concealed Object II - As Concealed Object I , except will af -fect an object up to the size of a one-handed sword.
8. Well-Aimed Attack II - As Well-Aimed Attack I , except bonus is +50.
9.  Open Ambush II - As Open Ambush I ,  except  the  limit  on critical roll modification is ±4.
10. Improvised Attack II * - As Improvised Attack I , except pen -alties are reduced by 40.
11. Lightning Reactions * - Caster gains a +20 to his initiative roll this round. This must be the caster's first action and the +20 applies to the casting of this spell.
12. Create Evidence II - As Create Evidence I , except two pieces of  evidence  are  created;  one  piece  of  evidence  is  incriminating (i.e., patsy will need more than a good alibi).
13. Well-Aimed Attack III - As Well-Aimed Attack I , except bo -nus is +75.
14. Open Ambush III - As Open Ambush I , except the limit on critical roll modification is ±6.
15.  Improvised Attack  III  * - As Improvised Attack  I ,  except penalties are reduced by 60.
16. Concealed Object True - As Concealed Object I , except ob -ject may be of any size, so long as the largest dimension of the object is less than the caster's height.
17.  Study  Victim -  As Study  Patsy ,  except  the  information  it gathers is required for use with the Slaying Attack spells later on this list.
18.  Create  Evidence  III - As Create  Evidence  I ,  except  three pieces of evidence are created; two pieces of evidence are incrim -inating.
19. Well-Aimed Attack True - As Well-Aimed Attack I ,  except bonus is +100.
20. Slaying Attack - The caster's next attack (within one minute of casting this spell) against the currently studied victim (see Study Victim ) will be resolved as a Slaying IV attack (+20 to the critical roll).
25. Open Ambush V - As Open Ambush I ,  except the limit on critical roll modification is ±10.
30. Improvised Attack IV - As Improvised Attack I , except pen -alties are reduced by 90.
35. Open Ambush True - As Open Ambush I ,  except the limit on critical roll modification is ±14, the caster has 10 minutes in which to make the attack, and he does not have to have a positional bonus.
40.  Improvised Attack True - As Improvised Attack  I ,  except penalties are reduced by 120.

See section 10.21 for a discussion of spells with 'Kind' in their name.

  

1. Study Disguise - Caster studies a person for use with disguise spells later on this list. The caster can only have as many disguises studied as he has ranks in this list. He may forget a studied disguise at any time to make room for replacements.
2. Light Glamour - One object (up to 10 pounds per level) has its  visual  appearance  altered  for  the  duration  of  the  spell.  Note that no other aspect of the object changes. This spell cannot make an object cast light (although it may alter the appearance of light given off, whether naturally or from another spell).
3. Façade I - Caster has a limited illusion on himself that allows him to look like any humanoid race within 20% of his own size. The illusion moves as the caster moves.
4. Shadow Assassin - All deeds performed while this spell is ac -tive are 'shadowed' to divination spells. All related visions gained through divination effect are shrouded in shadows. For example, a Death's Mastery cast on the scene of a murder might reveal a shadowy  figure  performing  the  deeds  (but  no  details  about  the identity of the figure).
5. Misfeel Kind · * - For the purposes of mental or magical de -tections, caster appears to be of any race with which the caster is familiar.
6. Façade II - As Façade I , except one extra sense is added.
7. Disguise I - Caster physically changes to take on the form and visual appearance of any one studied person (using the Study Disguise spell). This is strictly a physical change.
8. Unknown Assassin - As Shadow Assassin , except absolutely no information about the caster will be revealed. For example, a Death's Memory cast on the scene of a murder might show the victim collapsing with a knife in his chest (but no sign of the as -sassin).
9. Façade III - As Façade I , except two extra senses are added.
10. Disguise II - As Disguise I ,  except caster also takes on the vocal characteristics of the person mimicked.
11. Misfeel Calling · * - As Misfeel Kind , except caster's profes -sion may be misrepresented.
12. Psychic Tongue - Caster may mentally speak with one target; to the target it will seem as if they are communicating normally (i.e., orally).
13. Disguise III - As Disguise II , except caster also takes on the obvious mannerisms of the person mimicked (e.g., left-handed -ness, limp).
14. Façade V - As Façade I , except all five basic human senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) are included.
15. Misfeel Power · * - As Misfeel Kind , except caster's level may be misrepresented (to an upper limit of twice the caster's actual level).
16. Disguise IV - As Disguise III , except caster also takes on the subtle mannerisms of the person mimicked. This makes him virtu -ally undetectable to all but the closest of associates.
17. Unpresence Self - Target becomes undetectable by Presence spells or related abilities.
18. False Assassin - As Shadow Assassin ,  except all deeds per -formed while this  spell  is  active  will  appear  as  if  the  currently studied patsy is performing the caster's actions (see Study Patsy on Assassination Mastery list).
19. Disguise V - As Disguise IV , except even very subtle manner -isms are gained.
20. Misfeel · * - Allows caster to use all of the 'Misfeel' spells at once.
25. Nondetect - Caster and items on his person cannot be detected by any Detect . . spell.
30. Misfeel True - As Misfeel ,  except  it  has  a  ten  minute/level duration and does not require concentration.
35. Accomplice Façade - As Façade III , except duration is only ten minutes per level and it may be used on another person.
40.  Shifting  Façade - As Façade V ,  except  with  one  round  of concentration, the caster can change the façade to another.
50. Disguise Mastery - Caster may use any lower level spell on this list, once per round.

Note :  Spells  that  involve  teleportation  are  normally  quite  noisy and  difficult  to  silence.  The  Magent's  'Silenced'  versions  are much quieter, producing only a soft 'pop' that would normally go unnoticed except in an absolutely still environment. Of course, being seen using these spells by anyone but one's own associates is basically the equivalent of wearing a tunic embroidered with the words 'I AM AN ASSASSIN. KILL ME NOW.'

  

1.  Locklore -  Gives  the  caster  +20  bonus  for  picking  the  lock analyzed. If the caster takes a round to explain the lock to someone else, that person gets a +10 bonus to pick the lock.
2. Ungag - Any minor covering on the head of the caster made of organic material is loosened. This includes any gags or blindfolds.
3. Phantom Tools I - This spell allows the caster to perform one maneuver using a Craft or Technical skill as if the caster had a complete set of the appropriate tools with a bonus of +10.
4. Silenced Leave Item I - Caster quietly 'teleports' a single in -animate object to a point up to 100' away from its current location. There can be no intervening barriers in a direct line between the target and the point (for these purposes, a barrier is anything the object could not physically go through). The object has a maxi -mum weight limit of 1 pound per level of the caster.
5.  Untie - Any ropes (or similar bindings) that are binding the caster are untied.
6. Phantom Tools II - As Phantom Tools I , except bonus for tools is +20.
7. Silenced Leaving I - Caster quietly 'teleports' to a point up to 100' away, but there can be no intervening barriers in a direct line between the target and the point (for these purposes a barrier is anything the caster could not physically go through; a closed door is a barrier, a pit is not).
8. Silenced Long Door Item I - As Silenced Leave Item I , except the object can pass through barriers by specifying exact direction and distance. If the arrival point coincides with solid material, the object does not move (though the caster still loses the PP).
9. Unbind - Each lock or shackle binding the caster has a 75% chance of opening (modified by the sophistication of the lock, see Section 10.14).
10. Silenced Leave Item V - As Silenced Leave Item I ,  except target can be moved 500'.
11. Passing - Caster may pass through any inanimate material up to 1 foot/level. It takes 1 round to pass through 2 feet of material.
12. Silenced Long Door I - As Silenced Leaving I , except caster can pass through barriers by specifying exact distances. If the ar -rival point coincides with solid material, the caster does not move, instead being stunned (-50) 1-10 rounds, and the PP for this spell are expended.
13. Phantom Tools III - As Phantom Tools I ,  except bonus for tools is +30.
14. Silenced Long Door Item V - As Silenced Long Door Item I , except object can be moved up to 500'.
15.  Unbind True - As Unbind ,  except  will  also  work  on  fixed shackles (i.e., those that have been rivetted shut).
16. Silenced Leaving III - As Silenced Leaving I , except caster can move 300'.
17. Phantom Tools IV - As Phantom Tools I ,  except bonus for tools is +30.
18.  Flattening -  Caster  is  flattened  until  becoming  virtually two-dimensional. This allows the caster  to  slide  through  cracks and makes the caster effectively invisible when viewed from the side.
19. Silenced Long Door III - As Silenced Long Door I ,  except caster can move 300'.
20. Passing True - As Passing , except caster can pass through as much material as the duration allows at a rate of 10'/rnd.
25. Portal - Opens a portal 3'x6'x3' in any solid surface, through which anyone can pass. At the end of the duration, the surface is returned to its previous state. Anyone in the area of effect when the spell ends will be forced back out to the point of entry.
30.  Phantom Tools V - As Phantom Tools I ,  except  bonus  for tools is +50.
35.  Silenced Long Door X - As Silenced Long Door I ,  except caster can move 1000'.
40.  Tracklessness -  Caster  leaves  no  physical  trace  of  having passed:  no  footprints,  no  broken  twigs,  no  scent.  Non-magical tracking is impossible. No protection against magical tracking is provided, nor does the caster gain any unusual abilities (the caster will still sink in snow normally, it just will be left unmarked after the caster passes). Deliberate actions will still leave traces (e.g., the caster will not snap a twig off a tree in passing, but if the caster reaches out and breaks a twig, it will stay broken),
50. Silenced Teleport I - As Silenced Long Door I , except move -ment range is 10 miles per level. Making a precise appearance is difficult, especially if unfamiliar with the destination. The follow -ing chances for error exist: Never seen place (only described) = 50%; been briefly (1 hr) = 25%; Studied (24 hr) = 10%; Studied carefully (1 week) =1%; Lived in (1 yr) = .01 %. In case of fail -ure: first determine direction of error (randomly), then determine amount of error (make an open-ended d100 roll for the number of feet).

1. Copy I - This spell copies a document that the caster is exam -ining. The caster merely concentrates and touches the document with one hand and a blank sheet with his other hand. The copy is not exact (i.e., not a forgery). Note that the caster does not have to be able to read the document. Alternatively, this spell can tran -scribe (in monochromatic black ink) one scene that he is viewing onto  a  page,  creating  the  equivalent  of  a  well-drawn,  detailed realistic drawing. The process occurs at the rate of 1 minute per page or scene.

2. Listen - Caster can pick a point up to 10'/level away and will hear as if physically at that point (there can be intervening objects such as walls). Note that this means that he cannot hear where his ears are.

3. Duplicate I - This spell makes a hardened clay copy of a small, 3-dimensional object (up to 6"x6"x6"). This spell requires that the caster have enough clay to make the copy (at a one to one scale). The clay must start off soft (the spell will harden it). This process requires one minute of concentration.

4. Sensory Marker - One location is 'marked' so that the caster can find it again later with a Far Sense spell. The marker is au -tomatically located when the caster casts a Far Sense spell if the marker is within range of the Far Sense spell. A marker can be placed on any inanimate object. The caster can only have as many markers as he has ranks in this list; a Sensory Marker spell can be cancelled even if the caster is no longer within range of the marker.

5.  Copy II - As Copy I ,  except copies 1 page/scene every four rounds.

6. Far Sense I - Caster may designate any one of his senses to be used at a 'marked' location within range (see Sensory Marker ). The caster can use any perception abilities he has at the time (e.g., if  he  is  currently  under  the  effects  of Nightvision ,  he  will  have Nightvision at the marked location). The remote sensory point may be rotated to face any direction. While he is sensing at the marked location, the caster must remain immobile and concentrate (and does not have that sense available at his own location).

7.  Locate  Evidence  I - After  casting  this  spell,  the  caster  will know what (if any) evidence exists within the range which would implicate the currently studied patsy if found at the scene of the crime  (see Study  Patsy on  the Assassination  Mastery  list).  The evidence (if any exists) will be circumstantial, but will imply that the patsy was at the scene when a crime occurred. This spell pro -vides only the direction, distance, and description of the piece of evidence. It does not provide any details as to why the patsy will be implicated by the evidence.

8. Watch - As Listen , except caster sees from the fixed point (it can rotate).

9. Duplicate II - As Duplicate I , except will work on an object up to 3' x 3' x 3' in dimensions.
10. Copy III - As Copy I , except copies 1 page/scene per 2 rounds.
11. Far Sense II - As Far Sense I , except caster may designate up to two senses for use at the marked location.
12. Woodsight - Caster can see through wood (up to a maximum thickness of 1"/level).
13. Locate Evidence II - As Locate Evidence I , except two pieces of  evidence are located (providing such exist) and the evidence will be incriminating (not just circumstantial).
14. Duplicate III - As Duplicate I , except will work on an object up to 6' x 6' x 6' in dimensions.

15. Copy IV - As Copy I , except copies 1 page/scene per round.

16. Greater Far Sense I - As Far Sense I , except caster can move while the spell is active (though he must maintain concentration).

17. Stonesight - Caster can see through stone (up to a maximum thickness of 1"/level).

18.  Locate  Evidence  III - As Locate  Evidence  I ,  except  three pieces of evidence are located and the evidence will 'prove' that the patsy is guilty.

19. Greater Far Sense II - As Far Sense II ,  except  caster  can move while the spell is active (though he must maintain concen -tration).

20. Ironsight - Caster can see through iron or steel (up to a maxi -mum thickness of 1"/level).

25. Long Far Sense I - As Far Sense I , except the range is 500 feet/level.

30. Copy V - As Copy I , except copies 2 pages/scenes per round.

35.  Synchronized  Texts -  Caster  touches  two  similar  writing surfaces  (e.g.,  two  parchments,  two  bound  volumes  of  like  di -mensions, or two clay tablets) and so long as the spell remains in effect, anything written on one of these documents will also appear written on the other.

40. Long Far Sense II - As Far Sense II , except the range is 500 feet/level.

50. Copy True - As Copy I , except will copy any bound volume onto an equal number of pages (not necessarily bound). Also, the caster  need  not  examine  the  material  or  maintain  touch  contact after the spell begins (he simply casts the spell and then he can leave the spell running). The spell will copy pages at the rate of 5 pages per round (and will even copy color images).

Note : The Eyewitness spells create a specialized Overlay, as de -tailed in Section 10.10.

  

1. False Credentials * - [RR Mod = -20] Target will think that the caster has the proper credentials for the current situation (this could include passwords or documents).
2. Unseen I * - A single object is made invisible (1 garment, 1 naked body, etc.); until 24 hrs pass or the object is struck by a violent blow (being hit by a weapon, falling, etc.) or the object makes a violent move (i.e., an attack) or casts a spell of type E or F.
3. Eyewitness III - [RR Mod = -20] Up to three targets will incor -rectly identify the caster as someone else (all three will describe the caster in the same fashion).
4. Quick Cloaking III * - [RR Mod = -50] Affects up to three tar -gets. Each target makes an RR. Failure results in the caster being invisible to the target; others see the caster normally. If the caster makes an obvious action (e.g., talking, moving an object, etc.), any target  that  would  normally  sense  that  action  may  make  another RR (the GM may deem it appropriate to apply modifiers to this RR based upon the action the caster takes). If the caster attacks a target, that target may make another RR with a +50 modifier. If the caster begins to concentrate, he can extend the duration of this spell indefinitely (as long as he can concentrate).
5. Misleading I - Target's perception is skewed. All Awareness maneuvers are modified by -10.
6. Unseen II * - As Unseen I , except affects two objects.
7. Quick Cloaking V * - [RR Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking III , except affects up to five targets.
8. Eyewitness V - As Eyewitness III , except affects five targets.
9. Quick Cloaking Sphere I * - [RR Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking III , except every target in the area of effect must make an RR. New targets entering the sphere while the spell is still in effect will  need  to  make  an  RR  or  be  affected  as  well.  Once  a  target makes a successful RR, he need not make another RR against the spell, however once affected, leaving the sphere does not cancel the effect.
10. Misleading III - As Misleading I , except penalties are -30.
11. Quick Cloaking X * - [RR Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking III , except affects up to ten targets.
12. Displacement I - Caster's apparent location is offset from the actual location; all attacks have no effect 10% of the time. Each time a foe misses due to this effect, the chance of that foe missing again goes down 5%.
13. Eyewitness X - As Eyewitness III , except affects ten targets.
14.  Quick Cloaking Sphere II * -  [RR  Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking Sphere I , except area of effect is a twenty foot radius.
15. Misleading V - As Misleading I , except penalties are -50.
16. Quick Cloaking XX * - As Quick Cloaking III , except affects up to twenty targets.
17. False Trail - Creates a false trail with the same physical mark -ings (typically footprints) and scent(s) as the actual trail left by the caster, but Routine (+30) to follow (without appearing to be so). The trail can be laid out as the caster wishes, within the range of the spell. This can be especially effective when combined with some form of teleportation to break the real trail.
18. Mass Eyewitness - As Eyewitness III , except affects one tar -get per level of the caster.
19. Quick Cloaking Sphere III * - [RR Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking Sphere I , except area of effect is a thirty foot radius.
20. Misleading True - As Misleading I , except penalties are -100.
25. Displacement III - As Displacement I , except chance of miss -ing is 30%.
30. True Quick Cloaking * - [RR Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking III , except the caster can affect as many targets as he has levels and the range is only limited to the caster's field of vision.
35.  Quick  Cloaking Sphere X * -  [RR  Mod = -50] As Quick Cloaking Sphere I , except area of effect is a hundred foot radius.
40. Displacement IV - As Displacement I , except chance of miss -ing is 40%.
50. Eyewitness True - [RR Mod.: -50] As Eyewitness III , except affects everyone who sees the caster.

Note : Any spell on this list that requires the caster to touch a poison automatically gives the caster immunity to the effects of the poison for the duration of the spell.

Some Gamemasters may wish to allow this list to affect narcotics as well as poisons in the traditional sense. In this case, a Spell Mastery roll should be required, at a Medium difficulty.

  

1. Poison Lore - The caster knows what type of poison(s) are need -ed to achieve a particular effect. The GM may deem it appropriate to give the caster a bonus of +25 to any maneuver directly involving poison(s).
2. Poison Resistance I - The caster receives an additional RR ver -sus poisons (i.e., if the caster is poisoned, the caster has two chances to roll a successful RR).
3. Apply Poison I - This spell causes one dose of a poison to adhere to an inanimate, solid surface. The poison will wear off normally.
4. Work Poison V - This spell magically prepares a poison (up to 5th level in potency). This spell normally requires d100 minutes be -fore it is completed. Note that the caster must have the poison in its raw form before casting this spell (i.e., the spell does not create the poison; it merely prepares it).
5. Poison Analysis - Caster may analyze a poison to determine the exact effects and what antidotes are necessary. Poison may be on an item or in a being.
6. Delay Poison * - For the duration of this spell, all effects from a single poison are suspended. Note that the poison will still be in the caster and takes effect normally after the duration (though the spell may be recast to continue delaying the effects, and some poisons may leave the caster's system before the spell expires).
7. Transfer Poison I - Caster can transfer a single dose of a poison from one target to the caster (who can then use the self-only poison negation spells on this list to deal with it).
8. Apply Poison II - As Apply Poison I , except affects two doses (which can be applied to different surfaces).
9. Neutralize Poison * - Any poison inside the caster must make an RR with a -20 modifier or be neutralized. In any case, it delays the effects of the poison for the duration of the spell.
10. Work Poison X - As Work Poison V , except affects poisons up to a potency of 10th level.
11. Venom - The caster can convert any poison that he is touching into a venom. The poison will now be effective when introduced into the victim's blood stream (regardless of its normal method of affecting a target).
12. Apply  Poison  III - As Apply  Poison  II ,  except  affects  three doses.
13. Neutralize Poison True * - As Neutralize Poison , except poi -son has a -70 modifier to its RR.
14. Transfer Poison II - Caster can transfer a single dose of a poison from one target to a second target. Caster must be touching both targets simultaneously.
15. Venom's Touch - Caster can coat the target's hands with a poi -son. The target is unaffected by the poison.
16. Work Poison True - As Work Poison V , except affects any poi -son.
17. Apply Poison IV - As Apply Poison II , except affects four doses.
18. Contact Poison - As Venom , except converts the poison into a contact poison (a poison that affects its victim upon contact with the victim's skin) regardless of its normal method of affecting a target.
19. Transfer Poison III - As Transfer Poison II , except caster need only touch the target from which the poison is transferred; the target to receive the poison need merely be within the spell's range.
20.  Venom's  Breath -  The  caster  can  ingest  a  single  dose  of  a poison. For the duration of this spell, he will be unaffected by the poison. Anytime before the duration expires, the caster can attempt to transfer the poison to a single target. The target must be no further away than 5' and the caster's mouth must be capable of delivering the poison (either through a kiss, a whisper, spitting, etc.). The target gets an RR to avoid the effects of this spell (in addition to the RR to resist the poison).
25.  Venom's  Glare -  As Venom's  Breath ,  except  the  caster  can transfer the poison to any single target within the range. The caster must be able to cast an obvious, evil glare at the target.
30. Venom's Cloud - The caster can disperse a poison (which be -comes an inhaled poison) into a misty cloud. The size of the mist is one foot in radius per dose of the poison used. The poison will linger in the area normally until the duration of the spell expires (i.e., the mist will be subject to the wind, etc.). When the duration expires, the poison disperses.
35. Transfer Poison IV - As Transfer Poison III , except caster need not touch the target from which the poison is transferred, both tar -gets need merely be within the spell's range.
40. Venom's Persistence - Improves the potency of a poison such that any victim of the poison must make two RRs and take the worse of the two results. If in or on an object (e.g., goblet of a poisoned drink,  poison  on  a  blade,  but  not  a  person),  then  the  poison  will linger for 24 hours, even if normally effective washing procedures are done. This residual poison will continue to affect anyone who would normally be affected by the poison there, but it is diluted from the original potency and will allow a normal single RR, with a +10 bonus.
50. Venom's Sight - As Venom's Glare , except for the range.

Note : The task required by a Geas may be extremely difficult, but it must at least appear to be possible. A Geas must be removed as a curse or mental illness; see Section 10.2 for details.

See section 10.21 for a discussion of spells with 'Kind' in their name.

  

1. Honest Answer - Target must answer a single-concept question truthfully (assuming target can understand the question).
2. Sleep - Target falls into natural sleep. The first round of sleep is magical (the target cannot be awakened through normal means). Falling  asleep  is  rapid,  but  not  so  instantaneous  that  the  victim cannot slump gently to the ground (no injuries under normal cir -cumstances from falling to the ground).
3. Charm Kind - Humanoid target believes caster is a good friend.
4. Calm - Target will take no offensive action and will fight only in self-defense.
5. Confusion - Target is incapable of making decisions or initiat -ing action; he may continue to fight current foes or in self-defense. The target may also follow orders from the target's leader (if any), but  will  only  be  able  to  follow  them  so  long  as  no  ambiguities arise.
6. Fear - Target fears caster and attempts to flee. (This does not involve a Fear RR or the usual fear mechanics. Use a normal Men -talism RR and the result is flight for the specified duration.)
7.  Suggestion - Target will perform a single suggested act that is  not  self-destructive  or  diametrically  opposed  to  the  target's personality (e.g., no suicide suggestions, no blinding himself sug -gestions, no suggestions that a priest pray to an enemy god, etc.).
8. Hold Kind - Humanoid target has its Action Points per round reduced by 3 (i.e., normally, the target will have 1 AP each round).
9. Emotions - Causes any desired emotion.
10. Master of Kind - Humanoid target must obey the caster as specified in Suggestion .
11. Coma - [RR Mod: +20] Target falls into a coma.
12. Charm - As Charm Kind , except works on any sentient crea -ture.
13. Believe - Upon being told a story (or related series of state -ments) the target will completely believe it to be true for the dura -tion of the spell, defending it as truth.
14. Hold - As Hold Kind , except works on any sentient creature.
15. Geas - Target is given one task by the caster. Until the task is completed, the target has a -10 penalty to all actions not related to completing the task, so long as the target is making an effort to  accomplish the task. If the target stops pursuing the task, all actions are at a -25 penalty.
16. Hold Kind True - [RR Mod: -20] Humanoid target is para -lyzed and can do nothing.
17. Mastery - As Master of Kind , except works on any sentient creature.
18. Mind Break - Target is a blathering idiot. The target may be led around, but can take no action.
19. Hold True - [RR Mod: -20] As Hold Kind True , except works on any sentient creature.
20. True Sleep - [RR Mod: -20] Target is unconscious and cannot be woken except by magic; even awakening the victim with a spell requires that the waking spell make a successful RR against this spell.
25. True Geas - As Geas , except the target suffers a -20 penalty for actions not related to completing the task or a -50 penalty to all actions if the task is ignored. Maneuvers (not attack rolls or SCRs) directly related to the task receive a +10 bonus.
30. Mind Control True - Caster has total control of target's mind (when concentrating). After the initial casting, the range for con -trol is 1 mile/level.
35. Terror - As Fear ,  except target will always flee when con -fronted by the caster.
40. Charm True - Target is completely enthralled with the caster. The caster  cannot  control  the  target  directly,  but  the  target  will treat the caster as his best friend, believe him to be of the utmost character and will believe anything the caster tells him unless con -fronted with definitive proof of its falsity.
50.  Mind  Master - As Mind  Control  True ,  except  duration  is permanent (until dispelled); caster need only concentrate to give commands. Only one target can be so controlled at a time.

1. Empathy - Caster learns target's basic feelings; caster can con -centrate on a new target each round.
2. Read Emotions - Caster learns target's emotions in detail; cast -er can concentrate on a new target each round.
3. Merge With Mentalist - Allows two Mentalism spell users to communicate mentally and exchange Power Points.
4.  Focus Merge - When cast within one minute before a Mind Merge or Ready Merge or Hivemind spell,  this  spell  allows  the caster to focus on a specific person as the target. This target must be Mind Stored (see the Presence spell list).
5. Thoughts - Caster receives surface thoughts from target.
6.  Mind  Merge  I -  Allows  caster  and  target  to  interchange thoughts; if both are Mentalism spell users, they can interchange Power Points. They must be able to see each other or the caster must know the exact location of the target or the caster must use Focus Merge to locate the target. In all cases, the target must also be within range.
7. Prepare Merge - The caster prepares himself to be the target of a Mind Merge or Ready Merge spell, thus, increasing the range of the 'incoming' spell. The increased range is equal to the original range times twenty.
8. Mind Merge II - As Mind Merge I , except range is 100'.
9. Alien Thoughts -  Some  minds  may  be  sufficiently  different from the caster's own as to be almost incomprehensible, whereas others may be so alien as to create terror and psychic pain. When cast, this spell acts as a filter and interpreter which allows a caster to understand and tolerate these mental differences. This can be as mundane as catching cultural implications in someone's Inner Thoughts or  as  exotic  as  understanding  interdimensional  fish monsters which directly sense forces of gravitation, magnetism, essence, and luck.
10. Inner Thoughts - As Thoughts , except caster also learns rea -soning and thought patterns behind surface thoughts.
11. Ready Merge * - As in Mind Merge II , except for range and instantaneous nature of spell. Caster and target must have Merged before.
12. Far Thoughts - As Thoughts , except for range.
13. Mind Switch - Target and caster switch minds and spell-cast -ing abilities;  target  (in  caster's  body)  is  in  a  coma  if  not  also  a Mentalist. An unwilling target may make a new RR every hour.
14.  Sever  Connections -  Breaks  any  contacts  made  with  the caster's  mind  through  various  spells  or  other  effects,  regardless of how they were made. Connections may make an RR, but at a -50 penalty. Also expels any mental intruders in residence, such as through demonic possesion. Intruders only have a -25 penalty.
15.  Mind Scan - As in Inner Thoughts ,  except  affects  a  single target and caster can also scan target's conscious memories; at a rate of 1 scene/ round.
16. Far Inner Thoughts - As Inner Thoughts , except for range.
17. Skill Sharing - Spell creates a mental bond between the caster and one target which allows each to use one skill possessed by the other. This gives the borrower the skill ranks of the other so long as the spell lasts; in all respects, it is as if the borrower actually had developed those ranks himself. The following are not allowed as shared skills: Body Development, Power Point Development, Spell Lists. The skill ranks are not lost to the individual who orig -inally had them. If the caster and target are ever more than 100' apart, the spell terminates immediately.
18. Mind Merge True - As Mind Merge I ,  except range is 50'/ level.
19. Far Mind Scan - As Mind Scan , except for range.
20. Mind Probe - As Mind Scan , except caster can probe target's subconscious memories (i.e., all experiences).
25. Mind Switch True - As in Mind Switch , except lasts as long as the caster likes (or until an unwilling target makes an RR).
30. Thought Steal - Caster can remove one thought or memory from the target's mind each round.
35. Hivemind - As Mind Merge I , except range is 50'/level, and multiple minds may be merged. The location of the various minds must be known to the caster as in Mind Merge and the caster must have Merged with each of them before and there is a limit of one mind for every five caster levels. Any of the merged minds may interchange Power Points if they share a realm.
40. Mind Switch Others - Two targets switch minds and spell casting  abilities;  both  parties  must  be  willing  to  experience  the transfer.
50. Ready Merge True * - As in Ready Merge , except range is unlimited.

Notes : Except where communication is noted as being 'one-way', the spells below create a 'two-way' communication between the target and the caster. The caster is not required to speak aloud. The target speaks aloud, but the caster is actually reading the surface thoughts of the target (some targets may learn to use mental com -munication - any caster who knows this list is presumed to have this  ability).  This  will  allow  simple  communication  of  physical ideas  across  language  barriers  (things  where  the  word-meaning can  be  associated  with  visual  images),  but  cannot  handle  more abstract ideas without a shared language.

Note : The 'Presence' ability detects minds of better than animal intelligence (i.e., creatures with the 'Animalistic' or 'Mindless' flaws are not detected). The caster will be aware of proximity to within 10' distance, and a 1 AP action will provide general direction (above, below, left, right, before, or behind) to one mind. If a detected mind belongs to a seen and recognized (as intelligent) being, then the caster will be able to identify the detected mind as belonging to that being.

Notes : All  of  the  sensations  created  by  spells  on  this  list are strictly mental (i.e., not real). For example - the sounds created with Audio Attack are heard only in the target's head and will work even on a deaf person.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Distraction - Target is at -30 for all actions.
2. Numbing - Random limb of target is numb and useless.
3. Blur Vision - Target has a -100 OB modification for mis -sile attacks and a -50 penalty for all other actions involving sight.
4. Minor Sense Control - Causes minor false sensations in any one of smell, taste, or touch (e.g., an itch, a stinky smell, or a salty taste).
5. Audio Attack - Loud imaginary sound stuns (-50) target.
6. Audio Control - Causes target to hear any sound(s) cast -er desires.
7.  Distortions - Target experiences all sense impressions as distorted and confused. Target is at -25 for most actions, suffers double penalties if attempting to move faster than a walk, and has a -40 to Perception rolls.
8. Vision Control - Causes target to see whatever the caster desires.
9. Vision Attack - The sensation of bright light blinds tar -get.
10. Nerve Numb - Target is totally numbed; target is at -75 for all actions.
11. Hallucination - Target sees a nonexistent foe and must fight this foe until it is 'defeated' (i.e., takes damage that would drop the target). Foe has same capabilities as target but does no damage (i.e., always misses).
12. Taunting Hallucination - As Hallucination , except foe will never attack. Instead, the foe will taunt the target, using full parry against any attacks by the target.

13. Sense Control II - Causes false sensations in the tar -get's sight and hearing.

14. Unnerving Sensation - Target is troubled by sense of being watched by an unseen, sinister presence and seems to hear mysterious and disturbing whispers. These feelings distract the target, causing a -50 to all actions.

15. Sensory Overload - This spell overloads the target's senses.  RR failure by 50 or less results in stunning (-50) for the duration; failure by more than 50 results in uncon -sciousness.

16. Sense Control III - Same as Sense Control II , except affects any three senses.

17. Dangerous Hallucination - As Hallucination ,  except foe  actually  seems  to  the  target  to  attack  and  do  damage normally. The only actual effects are stun results and gen -eral  penalties,  due  to  the  pain  and  disorientation  that  the target  actually  feels.  However,  no  physical  harm  is  done. The target does not lose hits, does not bleed or suffer broken bones, though the target will experience these things as be -ing so while the spell lasts. The pain and confusion causing the penalties and/or stun vanish when the spell ends (target defeats the hallucination or caster stops concentrating).

18. Sense Control IV - Same as Sense Control II , except affects any four senses.

19. Sensory Deprivation - Causes total sensory deprivation, i.e., no sensory input. Every day of deprivation gives a 5% chance (cumulative) of a temporary insanity.
20. Sense Control V - As Sense Control II , except affects five senses.
25. Far Control - As Sense Control V , except initial range is  300'  and then once the spell is in effect, the caster can control the target's sensations at up to 1 mile/level.
30.  Sense Control True - As Far Control ,  except  caster can 'program' sensory input (i.e., sense X will experience sensation Y under condition Z) and concentration is only required to 'program' sensory input or change current sen -sations and the duration is 10 min/level and all senses are controlled.
35. Long Control - As Sense Control V , except for dura -tion. False sense impressions fade away if the caster stops concentrating, but the caster can renew (or change them) at any time by concentrating, so long as the spell lasts and the target is within range.
40. Enduring Control - As Far Control , except duration is as Long Control.
50.  Private  World -  Target  lives  in  own  fantasy  world, which may be totally controlled by caster when caster con -centrates. While in the fantasy, the target receives no senso -ry input from the real world.

Note : When under the effects of an Unpain spell, there are no penalties for hits  lost  beyond  25%.  Full  effects  of  the lost hits occur when the spell duration ends. However, if the hits are healed before the duration ends, there is no effect. So, a character could be reduced to -38 hits while sustained by Unpain , but restored to 2 hits before the duration of the spell ended. He would never pass out. Likewise, if Unpain allows fighting beyond lethal hit loss, this has no effect until the spell expires.

15. Unpain III * - As Unpain I , except 75% additional hits may be sustained.
16. Concentration V * - As Concentration I , except bonus is +50.

18. Unpain IV * - As Unpain I ,  except 100% additional hits may be sustained.

1.  Swing  I  * - Allows caster to leap up to 10' vertically or laterally, grasp and swing from a fixed object, and land perfectly (up to 20' away from the object). The object could be a tree, branch, rafter, rope, chandelier, etc. This swing is included as part of this instantaneous spell action (i.e., takes no additional AP).
2. Perfect Stance * - Caster is immune to stagger effects (includes 'prone' or 'knocked back' results) for the dura -tion of this spell.
3. Dodging I * - If the caster performs a Full Dodge for a round, he gains +20 to his DB. If he uses a Partial Dodge, he gets half that bonus.
4. Swing III * - As Swing I , except 3 swings may be exe -cuted in rapid succession.
5. Flip I * - Allows caster to 'flip' in any direction, landing up to 10' away (facing in any direction). This flip is includ -ed as part of this instantaneous spell action (i.e., takes no additional AP).
6. Soft Step I - Caster can tread very quietly, providing a +25 bonus to Stalking maneuvers when moving.
7. Dodging II * - As Dodging I , but bonus is +40.
8. Moving Dodge I * - Caster may move at up to a Running pace and Dodge without suffering a penalty due to pace.
9. Swing V * - As Swing I , except 5 swings may be execut -ed in rapid succession.
10. Flip III * - As Flip I , except 3 flips may be executed in rapid succession.
11. Soft Step II - Caster can tread extremely quietly, pro -viding a +50 bonus to Stalking maneuvers when moving.
12. Dodging III * - As Dodging I , but bonus is +60.
13. Shield Hand * - Caster can use his shield against two extra  attacks  per  round  (e.g.,  a  full  shield  may  be  used against 5 attacks per round).
14. Moving Dodge II * - Caster may move at any pace and Dodge without suffering a penalty due to pace.
15. Elusive Step * - Caster can perform a Partial Dodge each round without Concentration.
16. Defensive Contortion I * - Caster reacts to an attack to take some control of the placement of an unavoidable blow. This  allows  him  to  change  the  result  rolled  on  a  critical taken by himself by up to ±5. This only applies to criticals that result from attacks using a Combat Training skill (e.g., it could be used against a sword attack or a crossbow bolt, but not a Fire Bolt or a Wall of Fire ). This effect applies to the first applicable critical taken within the spell's duration, after which the spell is cancelled.
17. Weightless - Caster is all but weightless when standing or treading on a surface of some kind (but falling is normal). This allows the caster to be supported easily by tiny twigs at the ends of tree branches, unsafe roofs, and other surfaces that would normally give under the pressure of his weight. The  spell  also  greatly  reduces  the  impact  of  the  caster's passing, giving a -75 penalty to attempts to track him by looking for signs (but not by scent or by magic).
18. Dodging IV * - As Dodging I , but bonus is +80.
19. Freedom * - Caster is able to immediately slip free of any Grapple and this spell will also negate any Hold spell or power to which the caster was subject.

35. Defensive Contortion II * - As Defensive Contortion I , except adjustment is by up to ±10.
40. Defensive Contortion III * - As Defensive Contortion I , except adjustment is by up to ±15.
50. Monk's Move True - Caster can use any one of the lower level spells on this list each round.

Note :  Spells  that  involve  teleportation  are  normally  quite noisy and difficult to silence. Air is being pushed about in a manner not unlike a thunderclap. Amount of noise depends on the size of the object teleported.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1. Leaping I * - Allows caster to make one leap up to 50' laterally or 20' vertically (as a separate 1 AP action, with no Pace penalty for the leaping movement) in the round that the spell was cast.
2. Landing * - This spell may be cast when the caster be -gins to fall, taking effect immediately, allowing the caster to land safely in a fall up to 20' per level of the caster and to take that distance off the severity of any longer fall.
3. Traction - Caster can walk or run on even, unstable sur -faces (sand, ice, etc.) as if on a hard, stable surface.
4. Edgerunning - Caster can walk or run on even, narrow (at least 2" wide) surfaces as if on normal ground.
5. Leaping III * - As Leaping I , except the caster can exe -cute 3 'leaps' in succession. Each leap must be within 90° of the last leap's direction. Each leap is a 1 AP action.
6. Cornering I * - Allows caster to execute a turn up to 180° with no deceleration or unbalancing (can be used with any 'running' spells).
7. Levitation - Allows caster to move up and down vertically 10' per round. This spell does not confer any ability to control horizontal movement, which must be accomplished by other means.
8.  Landing True * - As Landing ,  except caster can land safely from any fall 99% of the time, and still takes the nor -mal 20'/level off any fall for the 1% of the time that safety is not complete.
9. Wallwalking - Caster can walk on solid surfaces up to 90° as if on normal ground.
10. Great Leap * - As Leaping I , except limit is 10'/level laterally and 5'/level vertically.
11. Cornering III * - As Cornering I ,  except caster may execute 3 such turns in one round.
12. Wall Flip * - The caster can leap up to a wall (no more than 10' away), bounce off and land up to 50' (horizontally and/or vertically) from the wall (facing any direction).
13. Wallrunning - As Wallwalking , except caster may run.
14.  Leaving  I -  Caster  'teleports'  to  a  point  up  to  100' away, but there can be no intervening barriers in a direct line  between  the  target  and  the  point  (for  these  purposes a  barrier  is  anything  the  caster  could  not  physically  go through; a closed door is a barrier, a pit is not).
15. Windrunning - Caster can walk or run on air if there is a wind blowing. However, running directly into the wind is not possible, and when running in any other direction, the wind's speed will modify the caster's movement rate (i.e., like the effects of wind on a sail boat).
16. Liquidrunning - Caster can walk on any liquid surface as if on level ground.
17. Leaping True * - As Leaping I , except caster may make one leap per round for the duration of the spell.
18. Leaving III - As Leaving I , except range is 300'.
19. Windrunning True - As Windrunning , except the cast -er may run against the wind with a movement rate unaffect -ed by the wind speed.
20. Ceilingwalking - Caster can walk on any solid surface as if on normal ground (includes ceilings).
25.  Ceilingrunning -  As Ceilingwalking ,  except  caster may run.
30. Run True - As Edgerunning , Windrunning True , Liquidrunning , and Ceilingrunning all at once.
35. Leaving X - As Leaving I , except range is 1000'.

Note : When selecting a subject for the target's Neurosis , Phobia , Psychosis , etc, the caster cannot choose something the target is in constant contact with (e.g., air, dirt, the Essence, etc.).

Mental diseases caused by the spells on this list are curses with mental effects. See Section 10.2 for treatment.

  

1. Insomnia - Target has trouble sleeping. Treat any sleep time as half as effective (e.g., count eight hours 'sleep' as four hours). This hinders hit and PP recovery. See RMCL Section 5.5 for effects of inadequate sleep on fatigue. Drugs/herbs or spells may allow for temporary relief by forcing sleep.
2. Neurosis - Target has an extreme dislike for any specific thing the caster chooses. Target has a 50% chance (modified by three times Self Discipline stat bonus) of overcoming the neurosis when given a choice (e.g., neurosis concerning horses would mean that every time the tar -get tried to get on or near a horse the target would need to make a roll in order to do so).
3.  Guilt - Target experiences chronic guilt over some action in his past.  The  GM  should  choose  some  significant  event  in  the  target's past. The target will not perform the same or similar actions again and must take steps to alleviate the guilt (acting to rectify the past wrong or, if that is impossible, similar wrongs).
4. Mild Paranoia - Target believes everyone other than his close as -sociates is out to get him.
5. Panic - Target must make an RR against Fear (use the highest level foe, or GM's judgment for other perils, as level of Fear) at -10 in any personally dangerous situation.
6.  Phobia - Target has a fear of a specific type of thing the caster chooses. The target has a 25+(three times his SD stat bonus)% chance of maintaining control around the feared thing. If the target fails to control himself, he has a 25% chance of fleeing from the object of fear (moving at maximum pace to get away from it), otherwise (75% of the time) he will avoid the object of fear at all costs.
7.  Hallucinate - Target develops a tendency to hallucinate and see things as they are not. For each major event in a day, the target has a  10% chance of hallucinating and seeing major threats as nothing major and minor things as major threats (similar to the syndrome that Don Quixote suffered from).
8.  Split  Personality -  Target  develops  a  second  personality  with different values. There is a 10% chance per day that the second per -sonality will become active (at a random time during the day). The GM should select d10 character traits that must be extremely different from the target's.
9. Psychosis - Target has a psychosis about a specific type of thing of the caster's choosing. The target has a 50% chance (modified by three times Self Discipline stat bonus) of maintaining control around the object of his psychosis. If the target fails to control himself, he will blindly attack the object (attempting to destroy it at all costs) 20% of the time, avoiding it the rest of the time. If avoidance is not possible, the reaction will be violent.
10. Catatonia - Target drifts in and out of a catatonic state. Every hour there is a 25% chance he will become catatonic for one hour.
11. Insomnia True - As Insomnia , except target can only sleep if he uses drugs or spells to induce sleep. He adds +100 to his RRs against all sleep spells. If he gets no sleep, he will slowly go mad (GM's dis -cretion on the specifics).
12. Neurosis True - As Neurosis , except that the base chance of over -coming the neurosis is 25%.
13.  Guilt  True -  As Guilt ,  except  every  day  that  he  fails  an  RR (against the original level of this spell), the target must take actions to atone for his guilt (or sink into a deep depression).
14.  Kleptomania -  Target  becomes  tempted  to  steal  things  at  ev -ery opportunity. It does not matter if the target even actually wants the  things.  The  target  has  a  chance  of  maintaining  control  equal  to 25+(three times his SD stat bonus)%. If the target does not maintain control,  he  will  steal  something  every  time  there  is  an  opportunity. (Check no more often than once per hour.)
15.  Paranoia -  Target  will  trust  no  one  absolutely.  When  in  a  life threatening/ dangerous situation, there is a 50% chance (modified by three times Self Discipline stat bonus) that the target will not trust the protection of others and will act unilaterally for self-preservation.
16. Pyromania - Target becomes tempted to set fires at every oppor -tunity. He will also take great pleasure in watching things burn, so this may tip off his companions. The target has a chance of maintaining control  equal  to  25+(three  times  his  SD  stat  bonus)%.  If  the  target does not maintain control, he will set something on fire. Check once per day; additional checks may be necessary if exceptional fire-setting opportunities arise.
17.  Paranoia True - As Paranoia ,  except  target  will  not  associate with anyone for longer than one hour per day.
18. Greater Hallucinate - As Hallucinate , except chance is 20%.
19. Psychosis True - As Psychosis ,  except  that  the  base  chance  of overcoming the psychosis is 10%.
20. Split Personality True - As Split Personality , except the second personality is active 50% of the time.
25. MPD - As Split Personality , except target develops d10+1 extra personalities (Multiple Personality Disorder). There is a 10% chance per day that a non-active personality will become active.
30. Catatonia True - As Catatonia , except every hour there is a 95% chance target will be catatonic.
35. Hallucinate True - As Hallucinate , except chance is 40%.
40. Utter Madness - Target suffers from one of the lower level spells on this list, but which one changes each day. This makes any attempt to treat the target through non-magical means suffer a -50 penalty.
50. Mind Disease True - Target may be given any mental disease that the caster chooses.

1. Mind Distraction - Target is distracted by an imaginary object. For the duration of this spell, the target wastes 1 AP on this distraction each round.
2.  Mind  Lock -  Caster  and  target  are  locked  in  mental contact until: the caster cancels the spell or the spell is dis -pelled or either the caster or the target has an RR failure of 30 or greater (both the caster and the target must make RRs against each other every round). The one failing by 30 becomes unconscious. While this spell is active, neither the caster nor the target can take any action.
3. Mind Invasion - As Mind Lock , except while target can -not take any action during the mental struggle, the caster may act as normal, within the restrictions of maintaining concentration.
4. Dominance II - The next Type 'Fm' spell cast by the caster of this spell (cast within one minute of completing this spell) will have a special RR penalty of -10.

6.

The target (in the caster's body) is inactive. The caster can cancel the spell at any time (takes one round). The target can cancel the spell if he makes a successful RR (he gets one every 10 minutes). If either body is killed, both 'souls' are destroyed.
7. Mind Battle - As Mind Invasion , except for range and the caster gains a +10 to his RRs.

10.  Demonic  Possession  II - As Demonic  Possession  I , except Demon is Type II.
11. Mind Slave - As Domination , except target is a zombie until he succeeds in his once per day RR. On any round that the caster concentrates, the target must obey him.

13.  Oppression - As Mind Slave ,  except  target's  'mind/ essence/soul'  is  in  agony  and  any  round  that  the  caster does not concentrate, the target will obey anyone's verbal commands.  Conflicting  commands  mean  the  target  does nothing.
14.  Object Domination - As Lesser Object Domination , except for duration.
15. Demonic Possession III - As Demonic Possession I , except Demon is Type III.
16. Waiting Domination - As Domination , except the tar -get  must  perform  a  single,  straightforward  task. The  task may take the target out of range of the caster and the target must still attempt to complete the task.
17. Greater Object Domination - As Lesser Object Domination , except for duration.
18. Mind Thrall - As Mind Slave ,  except the target only gets an RR once per week.

40. Demonic Possession True - As Demonic Possession I , except Demon is Type VI.

Note : Many of these spells affect a target's perception of a situa -tion. The duration of the spell is how long the target will incorrect -ly perceive the situation. At the end of the duration, if the situation has ended, the target will remember the situation incorrectly (as that was how he perceived it).

  

1.  Jumbled Text - All text that the target attempts to read will appear jumbled (and is indecipherable).
2. Hypochondria - The target believes that he is very ill (or sicker than he actually is). The GM should base the severity of the 'imag -inary' illness upon the amount the target fails his RR by (e.g., if he fails his RR by more than 50, he might think he is terminally ill).
3.  False  Sense  I -  Target  will  perceive  something  incorrectly through one of his senses. For example, he might see something out of the corner of his eye, or hear something that is not there. The sensory effect cannot last longer than one round.
4. Misleading I - Target's perception is skewed. All Awareness maneuvers are modified by -10.
5. Lesser Phantom - The target is attacked by a creature of shad -ow. The creature is actually a hallucination and only the target sees the  creature. The creature will immediately attack the target (in melee). The creature has the same DB, OB, and Hits as the target (use the target's highest melee OB as the creature's OB), but AT is always 1. If the caster casts spells upon himself, the creature acts as if affected by the same spell. The creature is immune to spell attacks. If the creature is slain (by killing or incapacitating it), the spell is cancelled. Creature uses same attack table as target, but damage is not real. However, if damage would render target dead or unconscious if real, target falls unconscious for the remainder of the spell's duration.

6. Waking Dream I - Target will view things as if he were in a dream. His reactions are slowed (he suffers a -10 to all actions). In addition, he will sometimes perceive things differently than they actually are. The GM should roll for each event that occurs with

<!-- image -->

a 10% chance that the event is mistaken. For example, the target might see an approaching horse as a large wild animal; or he might see the charging Orc as a messenger bringing news. Note that the caster  has  no  control  over  what  the  target  perceives  or  how  he perceives it.

7. Mistaken Identity I - Target will believe that the next person he sees is someone else. At the time of casting, the caster chooses what type of person the target sees. For example, he might see a servant entering the palace gate instead of the skulking figure. If  the  next  person attacks the target, the effects of this spell are cancelled.

8. Misleading III - As Misleading I , except penalty is -30.
9. False Sense II - As False Sense I , except affects up to 2 senses and the effect can last for up to 2 rounds.
10.  Minor Phantom - As Lesser Phantom ,  except  the  creature has an AT of 3.
11. Waking Dream II - As Waking Dream I , except actions suffer a -20 penalty, and the chance of perceiving things incorrectly is 20%.
12. Misleading V - As Misleading I , except penalty is -50.
13. False Sense III - As False Sense I , except affects up to 3 sens -es and the effect can last for up to 3 rounds.
14. Mistaken Identity II - As Mistaken Identity I , except target mistakes  the  next  person  he  sees  for  a  specific  person.  For  ex -ample, he might see the Chamberlain entering the throne room, instead of a burglar.

15. Greater Phantom - As Lesser Phantom , except the creature has an AT of 5.

16. False Sense IV - As False Sense I , except affects up to 4 sens -es and the effect can last for up to 4 rounds.

17. Misleading VII - As Misleading I , except penalty is -70.

18. Waking Dream III - As Waking Dream I , except actions suf -fer a -30 penalty, and the chance of perceiving things incorrectly is 30%.
19. False Sense V - As False Sense I , except affects up to 5 senses and the effect can last for up to 5 rounds.

  

1. Suspicion - Target suspects the actions of his associates (GM may give descriptions that arouse the player's own suspicions).
2. Trait Subversion I - One of the target's personality traits is perverted (that trait is taken to an extreme). If the target already has a tendency in one direction, it will be taken to an extreme: if  spending habits were affected, a thrifty fellow would become a  miser,  while  a  generous  spender  would  become  a  spendthrift. However, someone may still have a middle of the road trait affect -ed, in which case it might go to either extreme (e.g., someone not particularly brave or cautious could become cowardly or reckless).
3. Lying - Target has a 20% chance of lying anytime he makes a statement.
4. Trait Subversion II - As Trait Subversion I , except 2 traits may be perverted.
5.  Cheating - Target  will  attempt  to  cheat  on  all  matters  (e.g., splitting loot, card games, etc.).
6. Vandal - Target has urges to commit minor property damage. When such an opportunity arives, there is a 60% chance the target must attempt to commit such damage.
7. Stealing - Target becomes a sneak thief and has a 10% chance of attempting to steal anything that catches his fancy (if it does not involve violence).
8. Trait Subversion III - As Trait Subversion I ,  except 3 traits may be perverted.
9. Sabotage - Target becomes fascinated with subtle damage that endangers  others.  Every  time  he  is  alone  with  someone  else's things,  he  has  a  50%  chance  of  cutting  ropes  partway  through, punching small holes in waterskins, loosening saddles, etc.
10. Aggravated Theft - As Stealing , except target will use vio -lence to steal.
11. Trait Subversion V - As Trait Subversion I ,  except 5 traits may be perverted.
12. Random Trait Subversion I - As Trait Subversion I , except a different trait will be affected each day (with the previous day's trait reverting back to its normal state).
13. Assault - There is a 5% chance the target will assault any given person when he initially encounters him (the target must actually meet the person, not merely pass him on the street).
14. Arson - Target will become bent on avenging even minor dis -putes with the setting of fires. There is a 40% chance that he will attempt to set on fire goods or a building belonging to anyone with whom he has even the slightest quarrel.
15. Trait Subversion VII - As Trait Subversion I , except 7 traits may be perverted.
16. Random Trait Subverion II - As Random Trait Subversion I , except two traits are affected at one time.
17.  Maim - As Assault ,  except  there  is  a  10%  chance  that  the target will attempt to maim any given person.
18. Trait Subversion X - As Trait Subversion I , except 10 traits may be perverted.
19. Random Trait Subverion III - As Random Trait Subversion I , except three traits are affected at one time.
20. Homocide - As Assault , except target attempts to kill.
25. Assassination - As Assault , except target will take note of a person and plan to assassinate him later. This spell will last until the target has made an assassination attempt on a target.
30. Trait Subversion True - As Trait Subversion I , except dura -tion is permanent.
35. Assassination True - As Assassination , except each assassi -nation attempt will only allow a new RR against this spell. If the RR fails, a new victim will be selected and another assassination attempt will be made, continuing until an RR is successfully made.
40. Waiting Subversion - As any spell on this list of up to 25th level, except effects may be delayed until some trigger occurs (a word is spoken in the target's presence, the target visits some lo -cation, the next full moon rises, etc.). The effects may wait years until being triggered; the triggered spell's duration is based on the RR failure to this spell, where applicable.
50. Suicide - Whenever the target is injured, suffers humiliation, or fails in something, he will attempt suicide in some imaginative way.
