### 4. Casting Spells

Casting  spells  in Spell  Law is  not  automatic.  Such casting  takes  one  or  a  few  rounds,  expends  Power Points,  always  involves  a  risk  of  spell  failure,  and even if the spell is successfully cast, the target(s) may have  a  chance  to  resist  the  described  effects.  There can  be  some  complications  and  elaborations,  but  it is  a  straightforward  process,  easily  handled  within the context of either a tactical situation or outside of combat.

For those prepared to make a substantially greater in -vestment in obtaining magical effects than is required for  simple  spell-casting,  there  is  the  option  of  ritual magic. Magical Rituals are similar to spells in many respects, but they involve more time and more elab -orate methods of producing the magical effect. Many spells found in fiction would be categorized as rituals by these rules. Ritual magic can duplicate or exceed the  effects  of  spell  casting,  but  is  more  demanding (Chapter 5).

Realm  Stat :  Each  Realm  has  an  associated  char -acter stat that is used for a variety of purposes, with each character using the appropriate 'realm stat' for his own Realm. For Channeling this is Intuition, for Essence  this  is  Empathy,  and  for  Mentalism  this  is Presence. For Hybrid casters, the realm stat bonus is the  lowest  of  his  realm  stats  (e.g.,  for  a  Sorcerer  of Channeling/Essence, use the lower of his Intuition and Empathy bonuses).

Routine Casting

Spells cast outside of stress situations may be treated like other skills and allowed automatic success (no roll),  if  the  GM  judges  that  the  use  is  sufficient -ly  routine. This is not an option suitable to worlds where  magic  is  meant  to  be  exotic,  dangerous,  or unpredictable. It is suitable to worlds where magic has developed to a high art and is relatively common and everyday. The GM should also consider that this makes magic much safer (outside of those situations that are already dangerous) and therefore more pow -erful. It moves the balance of power significantly in the direction of spell-casting Professions.

#### 4.1. Power Points

Spell casting expends Power Points (PP) equal to the spell's level, so a 5th level spell requires the expendi -ture of 5 Power Points. (There are a very few excep -tions, noted in the spell lists.) If a caster does not have the Power Points (or some other source of power such as a Spell Adder) needed to cast the spell, the spell may not be cast. Each spell caster has a maximum number of PP equal to his skill bonus in Power Development.

Other factors may be introduced to affect PP in a given situation or game. Proximity to a Cleric's deity might result in increased PP, or areas of rich or poor Essence might exist on a world that would affect a Magician's PP. These factors, and any bonuses or penalties to PP they impose, should be determined by the Gamemas -ter.

Example: A Mystic (Essence-Mentalism Hybrid) with a +2 Constitution bonus, a +5 Empathy bonus and a +8 Presence bonus would use the +5 Empathy bonus for all realm Stat purposes, including calculating PP. If he had 8 ranks in Power Development and had taken Power Development as a Professional skill, he would have 40 (8 ranks x 5) + 2 (Con bonus) + 5 (realm bonus) +5 (realm bonus)+ 8 (Profession bonus) or 40 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 60 Power Points.

##### Recovering Power Points

Power Points, once used, can only be regained by a period of continuous rest, which could include sleep or continuous inactivity.  Characters recover 10% of their PP for every two hours of rest, to a maximum of eight hours of rest. Characters that need less sleep will recover more quickly but to the same maximum. For example, a character that needs 4 hours of sleep per night will recover 10% each hour of sleep but only to a limit of 4 hours. Please see RMCL section 12.1 for more options on campaign power level and PP recovery.

#### 4.2. Casting

In order to cast a spell, the caster must have ranks in the spell list on which the spell appears to the level of the spell or higher (e.g., in order to cast a sixth level spell,  the  caster  must  have  at  least  six  ranks  devel -oped in the spell list). The number of spells that can be cast by a character is dependent upon available PP or alternative means of providing power (i.e., magic items) and the level of the spells cast. Casting spells in a combat situation is governed by RMCL Section 8.1, which assigns a cost in Action Points (AP) to all actions representing how much of the round they take.

##### Spellcasting Roll (SCR)

A Spellcasting Roll (or SCR) is rolled every time a spell is cast. The SCR is open-ended. It succeeds on a positive result (1 or greater), causes spell failure (see Section 4.4) on a negative result (-1 or less), and the spell fails to take effect (and PP are lost) but no spell failure roll is required on a result of zero (0). The result of the SCR is the number that must be rolled against for RRs to resist the spell (see Section 4.5).

SCR = d100OE + List Ranks + Realm Stat + List Type + Other Modifiers

List Ranks : The number of skill ranks the caster has in the spell list being used.

Realm Stat : The stat bonus for the character's realm.

List Type :  Modifier based on the type of Spell List. This is +5 if it is the caster's own Base List, 0 if it is an Open List, -5 if a Closed List, and -10 if it is some other list.

Other  Modifiers :  These  are  the  modifiers  summa -rized  in  Table  4-2.  The  'Subtlety'  penalties  are  for concealing the magic of a spell to the extent possible. For example, a Fire Bolt will necessarily create a blast of  fire  at  the  target,  but  if  cast  with  subtlety,  it  may not be obvious where it came from. Many spells have no visible effect so subtlety is not required (unless the 'Visible Effects for Spells' option is in use), although the  caster  may  choose  to  cast  without  moving  their hands  or  speaking  any  incantation  (only  the  hands and voice modifiers would apply in this case). A spell cast with no visible signs and no hands or voice may only be noticed as an Absurd perception maneuver by someone actively watching the caster. Otherwise, per -ception is at -20 for no voice, -10 for a whisper, +30 for shouting, and -10 for no gestures or +10 for gestures with both hands. Visible spell effects will usually offer a significant bonus to detection but details depend on the  spell.Penalties  from  Subtlety,  Hands,  and  V oice can be reduced via the Spell Trickery skill.

Penalties  due  to  armor  interfering  with  Essence  or

Channeling  and  the  penalty  for  helmets  can  be  re -duced via the Magical Expertise: Transcendence skill. Essence and Channeling are penalized based on the percentage  encumbrance  of  the  armor  (including a  helm),  but  do  not  suffer  an  additional  penalty  for helms; Mentalism is penalized only for helms. Hybrid casters suffer the penalties of both their realms.

If casting a spell above his own level ('overcasting' a  spell),  the  caster  suffers  a  -20  penalty  to  his  SCR for each level of the spell in excess of his own lev -el  (e.g.,  a  7th  level  caster  takes  a  -40  penalty  when casting a 9th level spell). This penalty can be reduced via the Magical Expertise: Grace skill (but overcasting non-instantaneous spells will always require at least one preparation round). Grace must be purchased as a separate specialization for each spell list. There is also the general penalty for taking fewer AP to act quickly (see RMCL Section 8.1). Normally, casting a spell is a 4 AP action, but it may be hastened to a minimum of 2 AP, at a penalty of -25 per AP reduction. SCRs are also subject to other general penalties, as from injury, fatigue, or hit loss.   A caster also receives a bonus of +10 per consecutive round of spell preparation, up to a maximum of +20.

If a caster becomes stunned either during preparation or in the casting round before the casting action takes place, a Mental Focus maneuver (at the usual penalties for being stunned) is required to continue. If this ma -neuver fails, the spell is canceled but no Power Points are expended.

##### Spell Preparation

Preparation  to  cast  a  spell  grants  a  cumulative  +10 bonus to the spellcasting roll (SCR), up to a maximum of +20. The need for preparation depends on the type of spell and its level:

Instantaneous  Spells :  These  spells  are  cast  as  an instantaneous  action.  They  are  designed  for  speedy deployment of effects, often for emergency response, as to an arrow loosed in the caster's direction. Prepa -ration is possible if the caster anticipates the spell will soon be needed.

Non-Instantaneous Spells :  These  spells  require  be -tween  2  and  4 Action  Points  to  cast.  Preparation  is optional.

Overcasting Spells :  Non-Instantaneous spells above the  caster's  level  always  require  a  minimum  of  one round of preparation. They benefit from the same bo -nuses for preparation as other spells.

Spell preparation requires Concentration for the round (see  RMCL Section 8.1).  It  is  up  to  the  GM  to  de -termine what spell preparation actually consists of. It could be time spent gathering up the magical energies required to cast the spell. Or it could be trying to reach an ideal mental state for shaping the magical energies into the desired form afterwards.

Focused Spell Preparation

GMs who wish to restrict spell-casters may require that spell preparation be done specifically for a given spell or, somewhat more generously, for a particular spell list (delaying the exact choice of spell until the casting round).

##### Casting Level

When a spell is cast, it has a casting level equal to the level the spell's caster. This determines the effective -ness of the spell in many ways; depending on the spell it may influence any or all of: area of effect, duration, range, and Resistance Rolls (Section 4.5). A spell with a 10' radius per level will have a 100' radius if cast by a 10th level caster (10' radius x casting level of 10).

Casting Level based on Ranks in List

When using this option, the casting level of a spell is equal to the number of ranks that the caster has in the spell list from which the spell comes. This level is used for RR purposes and for all 'per level' vari -ability in the spell. However, the regular spell level is still used when determining any penalty for casting a spell above the caster's level (knowing a list to a higher level does not make the spell harder to cast).

This option also has balance implications. Spell-cast -ers will generally be somewhat weakened, but can be significantly  stronger  in  lists  where  they  have  spe -cialized. If the GM wishes to encourage specializa -tion among spell-casters and the use of double rank development  in  favored  lists,  this  option  provides an incentive. This also prevents a 30th level caster from picking up one rank in a list and immediately gaining benefits from level alone. This does hamper the Fighter who picks up a few spells at high level, but that character can select spells that are not so lev -el-dependent.

RRs will be harder to make against casters who de -velop their spell lists above their own levels. While this does tend to make casters more powerful, it also invites rapid list development (and thus a greater ex -penditure of DP on spell lists, or a reduced number of spell lists) much more than the standard rules. GMs using  this  option  may  find  spell-casters  are  more specialized  (but  more  powerful  within  their  more limited scope) even with easy access to spell lists.

Casting Level based on Power Points

The casting level of a spell is equal to the number of Power Points the caster expends to cast the spell (instead of the level of the caster). The caster must still use at least a number of PP equal to the level of the spell, but can choose to use more in which case the spell is treated as if it were a higher level.

The casting level is used to determine all level-based effects of the spell. It is resisted at this casting level when an RR applies, it is treated as this level for de -termining overcasting and all 'per level' factors of the spell are based on this level. A caster may not ex -pend a number of PP greater than the level to which he has learned the list containing that spell.

Example :  The  duration  of  Charm  Kind  from  the Spirit Mastery List is 1 hour per level, so if a caster used 4 PP to cast Charm Kind, it would be resisted as 4th level, and the duration would be 4 hours.

A spell cast using the bonus from a spell adder is con -sidered to have a casting level equal to the level of the caster or the level to which the caster has learned the list containing that spell, whichever is lower. A spell cast from an item (embedded spell) cannot be supplemented by additional PP from the wielder.

Example : Suppose Harcourt, a 16th level Magician who has learned the Spirit Mastery list to 10th level wishes to cast a 1st level Sleep III spell. He may vary the casting level of that spell from 1 to 10 by putting that  number  of  PP  into  the  spell.  If  he  used  7  PP , the casting level of the spell would be 7. If Harcourt knew the Spirit Mastery list to 20th level he could vary the casting level of the same Sleep III spell from 1 to 20, although if Harcourt cast the spell as 20th level, he would be casting a spell four levels above his own, which is not the easiest thing to do. If he cast the Sleep III spell using a +2 spell adder instead of his inherent PP, it would have a casting level of 16 .

This option significantly changes game balance with regards to spell-casters. Since the Base lists of differ -ent Professions have varying degrees of dependence on level-scaled parameters, this will not have equiv -alent effects on all spell-casters. There is also a mat -ter  of  making  lower  level  spells  whose  continuing usefulness lies in part in their low PP cost essentially obsolete at higher levels. In the above example, as soon as Harcourt decides to spend 3 PP, he might as well cast Sleep V. GMs should carefully examine the potential changes in game balance before using this option.

#### 4.3. Resolving Spell Effects

Once a spell  is  cast,  the  effect  of  the  spell  must  be resolved. In many cases the results are automatic, but when the target is a living creature or unusual object, various  results  can  occur.  These  results  range  from the spell failing to operate correctly to the spell being overwhelmingly successful.

Resolution  of  spell  casting  depends  on  the  type  of spell  being  cast,  but  always  requires  an  open-ended d100 roll called the Spellcasting Roll (SCR). Howev -er, resolution varies after the SCR succeeds (or it fails and the spell failure roll indicates a result allowing the spell to take effect anyway). Directed Attack Spells, Area Attack  Spells,  and  Resistible  Spells  are  useful classifications grouping spells using similar resolution mechanics,  with  everything  else  grouped  into  Other Spells.

##### Directed Attack Spells

Certain spells result in an aimed physical attack on a target. Most commonly, these involve elemental forc -es (electricity, ice, fire, etc., or more esoteric elements such as the sense element of touch), although teleki -netic  power  can  launch  a  physical  missile  for  much the  same  result.  Once  the  SCR  succeeds,  the  caster then makes an attack roll as described in Rolemaster Core Law Section 9.2, applying the normal modifiers for ranged attacks and adding the appropriate Direct -ed Spells skill specialization bonus. The appropriate attack  chart  ( RMCL ,  Chapter  10),  or  fumble  table ( RMCL , Chapter 11) in case of an unlucky roll, is con -sulted to determine the result.

##### Area Attack Spells

Certain elemental spells ('balls' and 'cones') attack an  area  and  are  treated  similarly  to  Directed  Spell Attacks,  except  that  they  have  certain  special  rules ( RMCL Section  9.3  under  'Area  Attacks'),  do  not benefit from Directed Spells skill, and every target in the area of effect suffers the result. While cover and shields can protect against area attack spells, well-cho -sen placement of a ball attack can often at least partly negate these defenses.

##### Resistible Spells

Many spells directly affect a target, and if that target is  capable  of  resisting  (any  living  or  magical  target, or any target within the 'aura' of a living being), then there is a chance that the effects will be avoided, re -duced, or (in the case of Informational spells) at least noticed.  This  is  determined  by  having  each  target make a Resistance Roll (RR). These spells are typi -cally spells of the Force type, although Informational spells  generally  allow  for  an  RR  when  they  have  a target. Other spell types may allow for an RR in some cases, as noted in the spell descriptions or allowed for under  Section  10.17  and  GM  discretion.  Resistance Rolls are covered in Section 4.5.

##### Other Spells

There are many spells that do not fall into any of the above  categories.  Use  the  spell  description  and  the general information specific to the spell Type (Section 2.5) to handle resolution. Because magic can have a great  diversity  of  effects,  various  resolution  mecha -nisms may be specified for individual spells or spell lists.

4.4. sPell failURe

If a spell has failed with a negative SCR result, roll on the appropriate Spell Failure Table (see Tables 4-4a, 4-4b, and 4-4c). Each realm has its own spell failure table. In the case of a spell from a Hybrid Base list, ei -ther of the realm tables may be used, but the selection should be made before the roll (caster's choice).

The roll for spell failure is an open-ended d100 roll. Modify the roll as follows: add up all the modifiers that applied to the Spellcasting Roll, sum these results, change the sign so that the number is positive (or zero if there was no overall negative modifier to the SCR), and add this number to the rolled number. Look this final number up on the appropriate table, read the text, and apply this result. Note that if a skill reduced the penalty from a negative modifier on the SCR, the pen -alty after reduction should be used.

Example: A Mentalist in a metal helmet (-75) with a +40 Transcendence skill would have an actual SCR penalty of -35 and thus would add +35 to the spell failure roll due to the helmet.

After a certain point on the charts, the results cease to specify that the spell is 'lost' (has no effect other than those listed in the spell failure result) and that the PP are expended normally, but these should always be the assumed result unless the text states otherwise.

When the spell failure result specifies a fatigue pen -alty, this is treated just like normal results of an En -durance  roll  failure,  with  any  fatigue  that  results  in excess of -50 leading to actual injury. When a critical is called for, but the type of critical is not specified, the GM should assign an appropriate critical based on the spell cast (Impact being a good default choice when no other is obvious) or whatever he thinks would be most entertaining.

| 76 - 90     | effect.

4.5.  Resistance Rolls

If the spell has not failed, the target of a resistible spell must make a Resistance Roll (RR). This roll represents the target's innate resistance to the effects of the spell and various situational factors. This roll is open-ended and thus always represents the chance that the target may not be affected by a very powerful spell, as well as the chance that the target may fail to resist a very weak spell. The exact result of the resistance roll may also determine the degree to which a spell affects a tar -get that fails to resist, most commonly by determining the duration of the spell effect.

For resistance rolls versus magical attacks, the roll is compared to the caster's Spellcasting Roll. If the SCR is unknown, treat it as 50. If the Resistance Roll (with all modifiers) equals or exceeds the number required, the RR succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Many RR effects are  all  or  nothing  results:  if  the  RR  fails,  the  target takes the full effects, but if the RR succeeds, the target is completely unaffected.

Other RRs, such as those against some spells, are in -cremental, where every X points of failure indicates a  greater  effect.  (e.g., Sudden  Light ,  which  causes the  target  to  be  'stunned  1  round  per  10  failure'). Most  commonly,  this  is  listed  as  a  duration  like  '1 rnd/10 fail',  but  sometimes  this  information  will  be in the spell description (as will more uncommon vari -ability in effects based on the degree of RR failure). In this case, roll the RR as usual; if the target makes the roll the target is unaffected as usual, but if the target fails, use the amount failed by to determine how many increments of the effect are suffered.

The actual roll is:

RR = d100OE + Character RR Bonus - 2x Attacker Level + Other Modifiers.

The following stats are used as modifiers for RRs ver -sus the three realms:

Channeling

: Intuition

Essence

: Empathy

Mentalism

: Presence

As  described  in RMCL (Section  5.6),  a  target's  RR against a given realm is based on the indicated realm stat bonus plus any racial bonus against the realm plus any personal bonus against the realm (such as from a talent) plus twice the target level.  This is increased by another +10 if the realm of the attack is the same as the realm of the resisting character. A penalty equal to twice the attacker level is also applied.

The  other  modifiers  mentioned  above  include  any magical  protections,  any  penalties  or  bonuses  based on the spell cast, and any circumstantial modifiers as listed  on  Table  4-5.  RRs  versus  Hybrid  spells  (e.g., spells  from  Healer,  Sorcerer,  and  Mystic  base  lists) use whichever of the target's two bonuses is higher. E.g.,  if  Kulas-Dar  has  a  Channeling  RR  bonus  of +30, and an Essence RR bonus of +15, use the +30 Channeling bonus when Kulas-Dar is trying to resist a Channeling/Essence hybrid Sorcerer spell. Apply all modifiers from Table 4-5 (and take any magical bo -nuses that may apply to the RR into account as well) before determining which bonus to use. For Channel -ing and Essence, 'armor' is determined by the armor worn on the target's torso, ignoring head and limbs.

Note  that  while  Utility  spells  automatically  affect a willing target, a willing target of a Force spell (or other spells permitting RRs, such as someone wishing to  have a Light spell  stick  to  him)  must  roll  an  RR, with the benefit of the -50 'willing target' modifier. A character may choose to always be a 'willing target' for spells cast by a given individual, as the character's aura  will  recognize  the  caster's  aura.  (This  may  be dangerous if the caster is not truly trustworthy or is being controlled by exterior forces.)

| AHybrid gets this bonus vs. all his realms | AHybrid gets this bonus vs. all his realms | AHybrid gets this bonus vs. all his realms |

Note that non-magical objects generally will not get RRs in any case, unless within the aura of a creature. If  the  GM  decides  an  RR  is  needed  for  an  ordinary object or normal plant, use a target level of 1. If an item  is  being  worn  or  carried  by  a  living  animal  or magical entity (such as a demon, elemental, undead monster, etc.),  including  sapient  races,  the  item  will resist  at  its  own  level,  or  that  of  the  being  wearing/ carrying it, whichever is higher. For magical items, the level of the item is normally the level of the highest level spell used to make the item (see Treasure Law for details). Items do not normally benefit (or suffer from) any bonus (or penalty) to RRs possessed by the person wearing/carrying it, unless it is due to a magical effect (i.e., an item will benefit from a protective spell covering its bearer, but will neither benefit nor suffer from racial or stat bonuses possessed by the bearer).

Example: Sigurd is 5th level and has a +40 RR bonus vs. Channeling (+15 for metal armor, +5 Intuition bonus, +10 [level 5 x2] and +10 for being a Channeling user himself) and is targeted by a Channeling Sudden Light from a 15th level Cleric. The attacker's Spellcasting Roll is a 76. Sigurd rolls a 27, so his total RR is 27 + 40 - (15x2) = 27 + 40 - 30 = 37, which is a failure of 76 - 37 = 39. To determine how many rounds he is stunned, divide the amount of failure (39) by 10. Sigurd is stunned for 4 rounds.

#### 4.6. Spell Mastery

Spell Mastery is the modification of a spell through minor adaptations in the usual manner of casting the spell. This allows the spell to be modified in various ways  to  change  behavior  from  the  normal  defaults, specify  effects  that  would  otherwise  be  outside  the caster's control (e.g., determine the exact type of de -mon summoned by a Summon Demon spell), modify the  sensory  aspects  (appearance,  sound,  odor)  of  a spell, and it also allows the spell parameters (range, duration, area of effect) to be reduced, but never in -creased. Some spells have certain Spell Mastery uses specified  and  some  general  applications  are  given below, but a creative spell-caster will require the GM to  make judgments as to difficulty of Spell Mastery maneuvers (remembering always that some things are so difficult as to be impossible), using these as guide -lines.

Spell Mastery maneuvers are rolled using the caster's skill bonus in the spell list from which the spell being modified  comes.  Use  the  standard Absolute  Maneu -ver procedure, with normal Failure meaning that the desired  modification  did  not  happen  and  Absolute Failure meaning that the spell has failed and the caster must roll a spell failure result. Roll the Spell Mastery maneuver before the SCR, but these are two rolls for a single action, so the spell cannot be aborted on Spell Mastery failure.

A common use of Spell Mastery is the modification of the sense aspects of spells to make them more im -pressive,  more interesting, or to express the caster's personality  or  identity.  This  type  of  modification  is sometimes called Spell Artistry and is a matter of no small pride among certain groups. For example, a Ma -gician might decide that he wants to cast a Fire Ball at a group of bandits. In the hopes that he can frighten them off if he fails to physically impair them, he de -cides to change the visual appearance of the ball as it rushes towards them into that of a fiery skull, adds a screaming sound to the skull, and also adds the smell of brimstone to the fire.

For multiple modifications to a spell, use the highest difficulty and increase the difficulty by one step (e.g., from  Light  to  Medium)  for  each  additional  modifi -cation. Checking the list below, the GM finds that a fiery skull appearance on a Fire Ball would be an Easy maneuver, but since there is also a simple audio com -ponent (the scream) and an odor, the difficulty is in -creased two steps to Medium. If the caster is attempt -ing to duplicate the exact 'signature appearance' of another caster or school's spell, add an additional -30 penalty to the roll.

##### Difficulty Examples

Casual (+70) :  Changing  the  color  of  a  visible  spell effect (e.g., the Fire Bolt is now green).

Simple (+50) : Changing or adding a simple visual or audio component during the round of casting (e.g., the Ice Bolt whistles as it flies through the air).*

Routine (+30) : Adding an odor to a spell effect during the round of casting (e.g., there is a smell of lavender as the target is hit by a Calm spell). *

Easy (+20) : Changing or adding a complex visual or audio component during the round of casting (e.g., the Fire Ball takes the form of a fiery skull).*

Light (+10) :  Reducing the size of the area of effect while leaving the shape unchanged (e.g., the Fire Ball is reduced to 5' radius). Adding or changing a simple visual or audio component that lasts throughout spell duration (e.g., the Wall of Air howls). *

Medium  (0) :  Reducing  the  duration  of  the  spell's (non-permanent) effect (e.g., setting a Light spell with a longer duration to end after fifteen minutes). Adding an odor that lasts throughout spell duration (e.g., the caster's Aura smells like baking bread). *

Hard (-10) : Adding or changing a complex visual or audio component that lasts throughout spell duration (e.g., the caster's Shield is visible and bears his family coat of arms). *

Very Hard (-20) : Simple modification of a spell area of  effect  that  changes  shape  by  selectively  reducing one  dimension  or  two  dimensions  (e.g.,  a  Goblin thinks the Undoor I dimensions are excessive and reduces the height to 5').

Extremely  Hard  (-30) :  Modest  modification  of  the spell area of effect within its parameters that can in -clude holes or significant shape changes (e.g., the Fire Ball now has a hole in it where the hostage is).

Sheer Folly (-50) :  Complex or functional modifica -tions of the spell area of effect within its parameters (e.g., a Wall of Stone spell is cast with hand and foot holds built into one side to allow an easy climb to the top).

Absurd (-70) :  Muffling the sound of a teleport spell (e.g.,  reducing  the  sound  of  a Long Door to  a  mild 'pop').

* - Sense components are restricted to the spell effects only.  It  is  not  intended  that  these  modifications should substitute for proper illusions. For more ad -vanced effects (like that screaming skull Fire Ball), some GMs may wish to use Illusion Crafting (or an alternate specialization of that skill) as a skill to determine the quality of such effects.

Some GMs may wish to make certain spells (such as the healing spells) applicable to humanoids (assuming the caster is one) by default and require Spell Mastery rolls to apply these spells to other species (a range of Easy to Very Hard depending on how different the tar -get is from the caster is suggested).

#### 4.7. Magic Items

Certain  magic  items  can  enable  characters  to  cast more spells per day; other items have spells embed -ded in them that can be cast by a user. Magic items in general are covered in substantially more detail in Treasure  Law .  This  section  merely  deals  with  some common item types and their place as substitutes for, or augmentation to, personal spellcasting.

##### Power Enhancers

Power Point Adders : These provide direct bonuses to a spell caster's Power Development skill. For example a +10 PP adder will grant an extra 10 PP.

Power Point Multipliers : The Power Points of a spell caster with a Power Point multiplier are increased by the factor of the item (x1.5, x2, etc). These are more powerful enhancers than the other two, with multipli -ers  greater  than  x2  being  rare.  For  example,  a  spell user with a 'x1.5' item and an inherent Power Point total of 30 has a net PP total of 45 points. Round up, so 31 PP x 1.5 = 47 PP.

Spell Adders :  Each  +1  on  a  spell  adder  means  that the owning spell user may cast (once) any one spell and not expend any PP. This spell casting is done as normal in all respects except PP expenditure; the spell adder  provides  power  for  the  spell,  nothing  more. These spell items can generally be used repeatedly (on a daily basis). Spells cast using a spell adder may not be of a level higher than that of the caster.

Power enhancers must be held (or at least worn) when used. So a Magician would have to have a wand in hand when casting if that wand was a power enhancer the Magician wished to use. (Having such an item in hand means you are using that hand for casting, so the hand(s) holding the power enhancer should count as a 'free hand' for casting purposes.)

Depending on the game world, Channeling power en -hancers may usually be keyed to one faith and only work for Channelers who are tied to the same source of power as the item. This depends in part on whether the  power  increase  is  assumed  to  come  from  taking in more power from the Channeler's source or to act more like a lens on outgoing power. It also depends on  whether  such  items  are  typically  the  product  of religiously-minded Alchemists  or  instead  created  as commercial products.

Example: The hammer shaped holy symbol of Thor that acts as a x2 Power Point multiplier for any Channeler of Thor may not work for a priest of Odin, almost certainly will not work for a priest of Loki, and definitely would not work for a Priest of Ymir.

A PP adder is generally usable by anyone, as it simply provides a skill bonus. Spell adders and PP multipliers usually operate for one realm or profession (e.g., a +3 Mentalism spell adder or a x1.5 Bard PP multiplier), but may be dual realm or universal (any realm) devices. A Hybrid may use a spell adder for a single realm for spells of that realm alone. Using a PP multiplier, however, is possible only if it is specifically created for the Hybrid's blend of realms, is specific to his pro -fession, or is universal.

A character can only receive benefits from a maximum of one Power Point adder, one Power Point multiplier and one spell adder in any given '24-hour' / 'day' period. Thus a character who owns a x2 multiplier, a x1.5 multiplier and a +2 Power Point adder could only use their x2 multiplier and their +2 Power Point adder in the same 'day'. If the x2 multiplier was stolen, then the character could use their x1.5 multiplier beginning on the next day.

##### Embedded Spells

Embedded spell items, rather than enhancing a caster's innate abilities, enable someone using it to activate a spell. The character must first have made a successful Attunement maneuver (or other requirements put on the item by the GM) in order to bring his own aura and that of the item into harmony.

When activating a spell, a Spell Casting Roll is made, except  that  Table  4-2  does  not  apply  (however  any penalty for using reduced AP for the action and gener -al penalties such as due to an injury do apply). Those modifiers are replaced by + ranks in Attunement and + realm stat bonus. The realm stat is determined by the realm of the spell to be cast, not by the character's own realm of magic. Any resulting spell failure is applied to the character, as the process of attunement has linked the item to the user's aura. Basic 'Loss of PP' results indicated that a charge from the item is expended, not that the character is drained of PP, however.

The casting level of the spell cast is usually the level of the spell itself (on whatever list it came from) and not the level of the character using the item. (Some exceptional items cast spells at a higher level, which is still fixed and not based on the caster's level.) The item provides the power for the spell, thus the charac -ter need not expend PP.

##### Casting from Runes

Using the Rune Mastery spell list, spells can be stored in the form of 'runes' for later use by anyone with the skill to do so. Casting a spell from a rune requires a successful Runes maneuver to decipher the rune be -fore casting is attempted. The rune provides the power for the spell, thus the character need not expend PP.

The casting level for a rune is the level of the spell inscribed.  This  level  of  effect  may  be  increased  by using a higher-level Rune spell than is necessary for the spell (e.g., a Sleep III spell inscribed using a Rune VI spell would be resisted as a sixth level spell). If the spell makes an attack that uses Directed Spells skill, the reader's appropriate Directed Spell OB is used.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The spell-casting procedure is as normal, except that the  spell-caster  may  add  ranks  in  the  Runes  skill  as well as any ranks in the list from which the spell comes and,  regardless  of  realm,  'free  hands'  modifiers  are ignored, while the rune must be  uttered  aloud,  with the modifications for Essence applied with respect to the  volume  with  which  it  is  read.  Since  the  spell  is actually being cast rather than activated from an item, all normal modifications apply, including the option of spell preparation, except as noted above.

#### 4.8. Special Situations

##### Canceling a Spell

The caster of a spell can, at any time, cancel that spell. The caster  must  be  within  the  spell's  original  range limit or within 'sensing' range of the spell's current effects. The  caster  cannot  cancel  the  actual  physical or mental results of a spell (e.g., fire, wounds, created materials, etc.). Cancellation takes 1 round of concen -tration.  Channeling  spells  may  also  require  the  per -mission or acquiescence of the caster's deity to cancel the effect.

##### Combining Spell Effects

Some effects  may  not  be  cumulative  simply  due  to incompatibility. If you are invisible, a Blur defensive bonus will not improve your DB beyond the penalty for not being able to see you at all. Furthermore, the effects of spells of the same name cannot be combined (e.g., the effects of a Protection I spell and a Protection II spell cannot be stacked), except where the ef - fect is a permanent physical result. Multiple Fire Bolts will cause multiple injuries. The GM may choose to prohibit certain other spell combinations, either to fit the setting or to control the power balance of magic in his campaign.

If  it  is  more  appropriate  given the game's setting or desired  balance,  we  strongly  suggest  the  GM  make more restrictions than are indicated in the rules. This may be particularly appropriate for spells on the same list.

##### Concentration

Concentration effectively takes up half of every round, by  making  all  other  actions  take  twice  as  long  (see RMCL Section 8.1). Lengthy concentration results in Endurance rolls. Casters attempting to hold a spell for long periods will need to consult the fatigue rules in RMCL Section 5.5.

##### Conflicting Spell Effects

When two conflicting spells are directed at the same area (e.g., Warm Solid and Cool Solid are cast on the same object), the lower casting level spell (or either one of two spells with equal levels) must make an RR vs. the level of the higher level spell. If the RR fails, the  lower  level  spell  is  canceled;  if  it  succeeds,  the higher level spell is canceled. Where more than two conflicting  spells  are  involved,  start  with  the  lowest casting level spell and roll an RR versus the highest level spell. Repeat this process until only one spell is left.

<!-- image -->

##### Delaying a Spell

It  is  possible to cast a spell and delay its resolution. Upon casting any spell, the caster may make a Medi -um difficulty Spell Mastery maneuver to stop it just before  it  resolves  and  hold  it  that  way  via  concen -tration until the caster lets it go at a target. When the caster releases the spell it goes off as an instantaneous action. The caster can choose to just cancel the spell as an instantaneous action, but the Power Points used to cast the spell are lost.

If the Spell Mastery roll is failed, or if the caster loses control of the spell via a failed Endurance roll to main -tain concentration, or if the caster's concentration is otherwise broken (e.g., by being stunned or knocked unconscious) then the spell misfires. Treat as a spell failure on the initial casting roll.

For spells with multiple targets, the caster can partial -ly cast it on some target(s) then stop and hold the spell per the rule above, and affect additional targets later until the spell has affected the full number of targets. The  consequences  for  loss  of  control  or  concentra -tion remain the same. Targets may be freely assigned during  the  round  of  casting,  once  the  spell  is  cast. Concentration is required to carry any unused target -ing forward into additional rounds.

##### Dispelling a Spell

When a spell is cast in order to dispel another, an RR is made. The level at which the dispelling spell is cast is the attacking level and the level at which the spell to be dispelled was cast is the defending level. Modifiers generally do not apply, unless specified by one of the two spells involved. This also applies to such spellagainst-spell confrontations as are brought on by Cancel  Channeling, Cancel Essence, Cancel Mentalism, Spell Hold, Spell Bending, Reverse Spell and the like.

##### Healing Spells

In order to use healing spells for injuries more serious than a few hits taken or rounds of stun, it is important to  consult RMCL Section  13.1  and SL Section  10.9. Together, these provide a full set of rules for a detailed healing  system  to  match  the  detailed  damage  deliv -ered by Rolemaster criticals.

##### Innate Casters

Many fantastical creatures and races have innate mag -ical abilities that duplicate spell effects. Such abilities are both similar to and different than the learned prac -tice of spell casting. As with other Innate Abilities, the GM needs to determine the source of this ability.

Due to the way their auras are directly linked to the essence  fields,  forced  separation  is  harmful  to  these creatures.  If  separated  from  the  essence  field,  either by entering a zone without magic, or via a spell effect, the creature will feel mildly ill and will be at -10 to all  actions until the connection is restored. After the first  full  day  of  separation,  each  day  it  is  separated will cause the penalty to increase by 10, until after the tenth full day of deprivation the penalty reaches  -100 and the creature  lapses  into  a  coma,  dying  after  the eleventh day.

Some Innate Powers actually are due to innate spell casting  in  which  case  the  creature  will  use  Power Points to cast spells. Innate spells are gained (up to the creature's level if a spell list) by being a creature of this type, not learned via training or education, nor can they be taught to others. Even though spells/abilities are gained by level ('Know 'Fire Law' to xx level') it is still primal and instinctive, not something the innate caster learned through instruction or research.

-  Power  Points  are  expended  as  for  normal  spells, from a separate pool of PP (if the creature is also a caster). These PP cannot be channeled and Power Enhancers are unusable.
-  Innate caster Power Points may be contributed to a Magical Ritual, but only as a minor contributor. To actually perform Ritual magic, the caster must use realm Power Points.
-  An SCR is required just as when casting a normal spell. The use of the ability takes the same time as casting a spell. The caster's level is used as a bonus in place of rank in spell list for SCR purposes and innate casters get the 'Own Base' bonus of +5 for any innate spell.
-  There are NO armor, helmet, or equipment carried restrictions.
-  There are NO incantations.
-  A gesture must be made, though it is subtle and uses the Mentalism penalties for Subtlety on Table 4-1.
-  Innate  Powers  may  not  be  cast/placed/embedded into Runes or Symbols, nor can they be embedded in  magical  items  by  the  most  common  methods. The  Psychographer  (Mentalism  Alchemist)  can place these powers into items.
-  Metamagical  spells  or  items  that  allow  casters  to modify spells, like ranging or extensions, may not be used on Innate Powers.
-  Directed Spell skill may be developed for any applicable Innate Powers.

##### Mastery Spells

A number of spells, usually at the 50th level and with the  word  'Mastery'  in  the  name,  allow  one  to  'use any lower level spell on this list once per round' (or similar  wording).  This  indicates  that  the  caster  be -comes infused with the power that the list  controls, allowing a state somewhat like that of someone using innate magic. A normal SCR must be made for each spell, but the minimal 2 AP may be spent casting the spell without penalty. No PP need to be expended, as the power of the original spell provides for the various spells  cast  after  that.  Beyond  these  two  advantages, spell-casting mechanics are as usual. If a spell cast in this way has a duration, it is measured starting when it is cast and expires normally. It may continue after the duration of the 'mastery' spell is over.

##### Repeated Spell Attempts

When a spell caster attempts certain magical effects (e.g., Uncurse ), that caster may attempt such an action on a specific item or situation only once per experience level. If the attempt fails, another attempt may not be made until  another  level  of  experience  has  been  at -tained and the caster has developed another skill rank for the list on which the spell is located. (This increase in rank meaning that the caster has new insights into this area of magic and improved techniques, allowing the possibility of success where he previously failed.)

##### Size of Spell Attacks

Unless otherwise stated, all spells doing damage on an attack table or dealing a specified critical are consid -ered to be of Medium size (regardless of the caster's size) and subject to normal size modification (e.g., a spell that delivers a B crit will do an A crit to a Big target and a C crit to a Small target). Spells other than those mentioned are not adjusted by size (e.g., a spell that does 1-10 concussion hits of damage has the same effect on any target).

##### Slaying Criticals for Spells

When a certain type  of  spell  delivers  a  critical  to  a specific creature, the critical may be treated as Slaying where appropriate. This process should be used when a  target  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  element  or force of a spell. For the most part, such vulnerabilities should be noted in Creature Law for the creatures de -scribed therein. However, a GM may add (or modify or eliminate) such vulnerabilities in order to establish the details of the campaign setting (e.g., vampires suf -fer Slaying III Holy criticals when those criticals are delivered by a Channeler of the god of the sun). It will also be necessary for the Gamemaster to specify any such vulnerability in creatures of his own design.

##### Touching a Target in Melee

While there are very few offensive spells with a range of 'touch', there are a couple of fairly common sit -uations in which a caster will wish to touch a target to deliver a spell in a combat situation. The first case is  when  the  caster  wishes  to  touch  a  target  in  order to  gain  the  -15  RR  modifier  for  a  range  of  'Touch' (see Table 4-5). The second case is when the caster wishes to make contact with an ally in order to deliv -er a touch-ranged Utility spell. Any unarmed combat skill  can  be  used  to  attempt  to  deliver  a  spell  touch to a target engaged in melee, with any result of 1 hit or  more  indicating  successful  delivery  of  the  spell by contact. The caster can choose to only attempt to 'tag' the target to deliver the spell, in which case no actual  damage  is  done.  While  a  friendly  target  may not actively defend (parry, apply a shield, etc.) against the caster's attempted touch, it is still difficult to make solid contact with an active combatant, who is moving unpredictably in an environment where the caster must also look to his own safety, so DB due to Quickness, magical armor, applicable spells, etc. still applies.

##### Variability of Spells of the Same Name

Spells having the same name, but occurring on differ -ent lists, are necessarily similar; they may be found at different levels (depending on their relationship to the source of power), and may have different parameters (a Mentalism version may be a 'self' spell while the Essence version affects a 'target').

Always  remember  that  spell  descriptions  should  be read in context with the other spells on the same list. If  an  upper  level  spell  of  the  same  name  specifies  a certain effect, the lower level version will necessarily have a lesser effect.

Many  of  the  spells  in  this  book  have  been  named with a numerical progression (e.g., the Fly spells: Fly I, Fly III, Fly V , etc.) to reflect their basic similarity. These spells should be considered the same spell but for the enhancements unique to each. This means, for instance,  that  two  spells  of  the  same  name  may  not affect a target simultaneously; the one with the greater effect will take effect, replacing the lesser effect (al -though if the lesser effect should have a duration that exceeds that of the greater effect, it will reemerge once the greater effect disappears).
