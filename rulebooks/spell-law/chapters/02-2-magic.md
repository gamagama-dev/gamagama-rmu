### 2. Magic

How magic works in a campaign is particular to the setting. It may be rare or common, and how spell cast -ers draw upon their power depends on the world. Spell Law presents a basic history of magic and divides it into three different realms of power: Channeling, Es -sence, and Mentalism. This presentation may not fit well into the setting, so Gamemasters should feel free to change the material to fit their own game worlds, histories,  and  concepts  of  magic  (see  Section  2.8: 'Customizing Magic').

#### 2.1. History of Magic

The truth is that nobody really knows how magic be -gan, other than some high and mighty immortal be -ings that generally remain aloof from mere mortals or tell us what they think we should believe rather than the strict truth. Each of the realms makes a claim of having been the first discovered, and each has an ar -gument that is plausible in isolation. Weighed against each other, however, they are collectively unconvinc -ing. Few have dared claim that some form of Hybrid casting came first, but there are those who declare that a  primal  'Arcane'  magic  came  first,  usually  on  the basis of some dubious analogy, while others speak of 'Shaping', a form of magic in which the pure will of the caster shaped the inherent power in the environ -ment (not merely that power preconditioned through the caster's brain as in Mentalism) into magical effects.

Channeling's claim to priority is a simple one: gods and  spirits  existed  before  spell-casters.  While  their inherent  preternatural  powers  may  resemble  magic, these are of an entirely different order, so the Chan -neling argument does not settle the question. It does seem, however, that as soon as the mortal mind was able to hold the thought of a spell, the power and the knowledge of how to use it could have been provided by these ancient immortals. The other realms would then  have  arisen  from  mortals  who  sought  similar power experimenting in mimicry of Channeled power.

Essence's claim to priority is based on its basic nature as magic: power is drawn from the environment and manipulated into generally straightforward effects. Just as mortals learned to work wood and stone and metal, they learned to work the living Essence that permeates their world. Some myths tell of such knowledge being handed down by some god, but still give priority to Essence, with the gods only taking on 'pets' later. It is true that many of those races considered to be among the  oldest  have  a  demonstrated  affinity  for  Essence magic, which offers some evidence for this position.

Mentalism's claim to priority is that it is the most nat -ural  form  of  spell-casting.  No  elaborate  methods  of words of power or subtle gestures need to be taught by some higher power or stumbled upon by lengthy empirical investigations. The caster need merely prop -erly form the thought of the spell effect and apply the necessary  will.  Discipline  and  determination  are  all that is required for Mentalism to emerge. The power of the mind is also conveniently located: we live our lives inside our minds. Those who hold this view of -ten  believe  that  Mentalism  Hybrids  were  a  stepping stone on the path to developing pure use of Essence and Channeling.

Then there is the question of whether spells or rituals came first. This argument has filled many a scholarly tome and kept many a band of wandering adventurers amused on a rainy night at the local inn, but again there has been no resolution. It seems most likely that the two forms developed simultaneously in parallel. For quick use, especially in emergencies, spells are vital; when time and resources allow, the ability to stretch one's abilities through ritual is likewise too valuable to have been long ignored.

What about the future? Will there be a revival of some ancient art of Arcane magic or Shaping? Will some -one pursue Hybrid magic to its logical conclusion in a  union of all three realms? Will some fourth realm be  discovered?  Time  will  tell.  Certainly,  dedicated researchers will continue to develop new spell lists or variants  on  the  old.  New  applications  will  be  found for old spells. Perhaps even the issue of realm priority will be resolved.

#### 2.2. Realms of Magic

The  different  realms  of  magic  use  different  sources of  power  and  have  specific  expectations  of  how  the spells are to be cast, resulting in restrictions for casters of that realm. Each realm of magic is also associated with a different Statistic ( Rolemaster Core Law Section 2.5: Stats), given below at the beginning of each realm description.

##### Channeling

( Intuition ) When the power to cast a spell is provid -ed from a source sending that power to the caster, the magic belongs to the realm of Channeling. Typically, the power provided to a Channeling spell-caster comes from a god or goddess, although depending on the set -ting, it might also be provided by spirits, a demon, a dragon, or even a powerful computer. All that is really needed is that the power source has power to spare, the technique to transmit it, and the willingness to do so  (or  in  place  of  the  last  two,  simply  a  nature  that allows those properly 'attuned' to the source to tap into it). As a result of this reliance on an outside entity, Channeling spell-casters have a loyalty tied into their magic, and they are usually devout followers.

Restrictions: Channeling  is  best  done  with  at  least one hand free (for gesturing), vocalization, and a very limited amount of metal on one's person. The source of power, if a sentient being, may have expectations about  those  using  the  Channeled  power,  which  are frequently  formalized  requirements  in  a  church  or similar organization. Metal, especially metal armor, is of some protection against Channeling spells.

##### Essence

( Empathy ) Essence is the power that exists in every -one and everything in and on the world. A spell cast -er  of  the  Essence  taps  this  power,  using  the  caster's personal essence field, or aura, to limit and control it. The caster draws this power, then molds and diverts it into specific spells. Many of Essence magic's power -ful spells reflect the material flavor of essence drawn directly from the physical plane and are elemental in nature.

Restrictions: Essence spells are best cast with hands free,  vocalizations  performed,  and  very  little  inert matter on one's person. A target armored in inert matter will find it easier to resist the power of the Essence, more so if the armor is metallic. While the wielder of Essence need not bend a knee to any patron power, the expedient course is often to tie oneself to a guild or mentor to gain access to new spells.

##### Mentalism

( Presence )  Mentalism  is  the  power  of  the  local  Es -sence field drawn by will and channeled through the mind of the spell caster, who in effect acts as a very, very minor deity for these purposes. Thus, Mentalism is a very personal power and even the most powerful spells are usually limited by the senses and perceptions of the spell caster. Mentalism offers a diverse range of abilities, but the scope is typically more limited than with other realms, affecting only the caster or a limited number of targets.

Restrictions: Mentalism casting is mainly done by an exertion of will. It works smoothly without the ges -tures or incantations typical of the other two realms, but if the head is covered, this can interfere with the conversion of magical power into a well-formed spell. Thus, while body armor and weapons do not interfere with  Mentalism  spells,  Mentalism  spell  casters  are advised to go without a helm, and a helm worn by a target will provide some defense against Mentalism.

##### Hybrid Magic

Some  spell  casters  draw  power  from  two  of  the realms  of  magic;  these  individuals  practice  what  is known as hybrid magic. Hybrid magic is the blend -ing of the power of two or three realms, resulting in different  combinations:  Channeling-Essence,  Chan -neling-Mentalism, Essence-Mentalism, and even, po -tentially, Channeling-Essence-Mentalism. This allows a great deal of flexibility as they have potential access to more spells. A Hybrid Spellcaster will also have a set  of  Base lists  which blend the techniques of both realms to provide a unique set of abilities.

Restrictions: A Hybrid spell-caster is usually under the greatest restrictions of all spell-casters. Since pow -er and techniques of two realms are blended, the most restrictive penalties apply. This provides some balance to the Hybrid's broad spell selection.

##### Arcane Magic

There are said by some to be other types of magic, older, more exotic, wilder, or more obscure, that fall outside the categories of the three realms. If such exist, they are not dealt with here. While the core rules are written to support the addition of such proto-magic, no such magic is presented at this time.

<!-- image -->

#### 2.3. Spellcasters

Spellcasters  are  classified  according  to  their  realms of power and their professions. This is assumed to be based on training or aptitude in early life and thus a factor  inherent  in  a  Profession  ( RMCL Section  2.4). Other professions are, of course, possible. Some GMs may wish to devise their own, make modification to those  provided,  or  disallow  certain  of  the  core  rule professions as they see fit in order to match the rules to their game settings.

##### Pure Spellcasters

Pure  Spellcasters  have  concentrated  solely  on  one realm of power. Thus, their spells are generally more powerful than those employed by the other Spellcast -ers.

Alchemists: Each of the three realms of magic has its own brand of Alchemist, a specialist in the creation of  magical  objects,  with  which  their  base  lists  deal. Their base lists are detailed in Treasure Law ,  not  in Spell Law .

Cleric: Clerics  are  Pure  Spellcasters who have con -centrated in spells that require the most direct power from their deities. Their base spells deal directly with life,  communing  with  deities,  summoning  live  crea -tures,  protection  from  servants  of  opposing  deities, and direct  channeling  from  their  own  deities. These spell users are the most powerful of the spell users of Channeling, but they should also be the most restrict -ed in the sense of heeding the desires or creed of their deity or church.

Druid: Druids are Pure Spellcasters who have concen -trated on spells that deal with the natural world. Their base  spells  deal  with  herbs,  other  plants,  animals, weather, and nature in general. Depending on setting, they can be modernized tree-huggers, quasi-historical protectors of their people against the awesome powers of nature, or simply rural cultists with strange rituals.

Illusionist: Illusionists  are  Pure  Spellcasters  of  Essence who have concentrated in spells of misdirection and illusion. Their basic spells deal mainly with the manipulation of elements and forces that affect the hu -man senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, mental impulses, and the combination of these senses. More subtle than the Magician, the Illusionist is less direct, but no less powerful.

Lay  Healer: Lay  Healers  are  Pure  Spellcasters  of Mentalism who have concentrated on spells that heal persons and animals. Their base spells deal with heal -ing diseases and injuries, as well as the creation and animation of prosthetics. They can also learn mundane medical skills easily.

Magician: Magicians are Pure Spellcasters who have concentrated on the elemental spells. Their base spells deal with the six elements of Rolemaster : earth, fire, ice,  light  (which  includes  electricity),  water,  and wind. They have many spells that hurl bolts and balls of these elements to potentially deadly effect and thus Magicians are often found on battlefields. They can also learn all manner of magical skills with ease.

Mentalist: Mentalists are Pure Spellcasters of Mental -ism who concentrate on spells that deal with the mind and senses. Their base spells deal with the reading of mental presences, mental communications, mind con -trol, and sense control. As students of the human ani -mal, Mentalists can easily learn discipline and social skills. They make ideal conspirators.

##### Hybrid Spellcasters

Hybrid  Spellcasters  are  professions  combining  two realms of power. This allows enormous flexibility, but the spell caster must abide by the restrictions of both realms (Section 2.2).

Sorcerer: Sorcerers  combine  the  raw  power  of  the Realm  of  Essence  with  the  fervor  of  the  Realm  of Channeling  (Intuition  and  Empathy  Realm  Stats). Their base spells deal with the destruction of both liv -ing beings (bodies, souls, and minds) and inanimate material.

Healer: Healers  combine  the  realms  of  Channeling and Mentalism (Intuition and Presence Realm Stats). They have concentrated on spells of self-healing and the  ability  to  take  the  injuries  of  others  upon  them -selves. Thus, a Healer could heal a person by taking the injury of the patient upon himself and then heal -ing this injury gradually. They can easily learn both Body Development (to help survive this process) and medical skills (to help others short of taking on their wounds).

Mystic: Mystics combine the realms of Essence and Mentalism  (Empathy  and  Presence  Realm  Stats)  to power subtle spells of misdirection and modification. Their base spells deal with personal illusions as well as the modification of matter.

<!-- image -->

##### Semi Spellcasters

Semi  Spellcasters  combine  a  realm  of  power  with more of a focus on physical skills. Members of these professions are not as adept as more specialized types in  either  martial  prowess  or  magical  power,  but  by combining both spells and skills, they have a certain synergy. In the long run, they may be the most power -ful of characters.

<!-- image -->

Bard: Bards are Semi Spellcasters of Essence. Bards are musicians, entertainers, gossips, and loremasters. Their base spells augment those roles, but also weave music into spells to baffle foes and aid friends, as well as providing unparalleled affinity with magical items.

Dabbler: Dabblers  are  Semi  Spellcasters  who  aug -ment  their  subterfuge  capabilities  using  Essence.  A Dabbler's base spells tend to enhance natural abilities in  many areas, with the most distinctive lists giving the Dabbler an edge in commerce and with machinery. In a more advanced setting, the Dabbler's most natural role might be as a mechanic or engineer.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Magent: Magents are Semi Spellcasters with unpar -alleled  espionage  skills  and  spells.  Magents  are  de -signed to be magical assassins or secret agents with base spells that deal in poison, information gathering, assassination and getting away, both physically and in terms of misdirecting the placement of blame.

Monk: Monks  are  Semi  Spellcasters  who  combine skill at Arms with Mentalism spells. Their base spells are strictly personal in nature, allowing them to per -form great physical feats and augment their attacks. What Hong Kong style cinema achieves with wires and props, the Monk does with magic.

Paladin: Staunch defenders of the faith, Paladins are Semi Spellcasters who combine combat prowess with utility spells. The Paladin is a highly focused holy war -rior, able to develop good fighting skills and spells that support his role as a warrior and a leader in combat. The Paladin is a capable combatant in any situation, but especially excels against the supernatural foes of his faith.

Ranger: Rangers are Semi Spellcasters who combine Arms with Channeling, specializing in outdoor skills and spells that influence nature. Rangers are talented in perception and outdoor skills, and while not as quick to learn weapons as the Paladin, have decent combat skill costs. A Ranger's base lists have many uses, but many of the spells enhance his skills in tracking, wil -derness  stealth,  wilderness  survival,  and  movement. The Ranger can be a deadly commando.

#### 2.4. Spell Lists

Spell  lists  are  classified  according  to  their  realm  of power and availability to certain professions.

One of the basic aspects of this system is the use of spell lists and experience levels (or just levels). This section  covers  the  use  of  the Spell  Law spell  lists, while  information  on Rolemaster experience  levels can be found in Rolemaster Core Law (Section  2.8: Advancement).

A  spell  list  is  an  ordering  of  spells  based  upon  the correlation  of  spell  level,  intricacy  of  the  spell,  and potency of the spell. All spells in a list have common characteristics and attributes, although each may have vastly different effects and applications. Spell lists are learned not only as rote words or gestures, but as inter -related theories and concepts regarding the theme(s)

of the list. This is why the spells are in the form of progressive lists. One cannot simply memorize a set of finger movements and ancient words and produce a Fire Ball .  One must first gain an understanding of fire  magic  sufficient  to  adequately  conceptualize  the necessary manifestation in order to guide the magical power into shaping the proper form.

If there is no spell on a list at a given level, it signifies that no new spell ability is gained from knowledge of that  list  at  that  level.  There  are  spells  at  every  level up to level 20, after which spells appear at levels 25, 30, 35, 40, and 50. While obtaining these higher level spells requires the purchase of ranks in a list that pro -vide no new spells (e.g., levels 21, 22, 23, and 24 on the way to 25), these spells are generally quite pow -erful even in Open spell lists and reward those patient enough to complete the necessary studies.

##### Base Spell Lists

There  are  six  Base  spell  lists  for  each  spell-using profession.  These  spell  lists  represent  professional specialties;  it  is  very  difficult  to  learn  Base  lists  for another profession (i.e., they are expensive in terms of  Development  Points),  if  the  GM  allows  it  at  all. In many settings, simply gaining access to these lists will be difficult as guilds or religious orders will guard their secrets.

##### Closed Spell Lists

Closed spell lists involve the deepest and most pow -erful  concepts  common  to  each  realm  of  magic,  re -quiring considerable dedication and specialization to master  or  learn  at  all.  Pure  Spellcasters  have  fairly easy  access  even  to  the  Closed  lists  of  their  chosen realm. Hybrid Spellcasters have similar access to the Closed lists of two realms. Closed lists are generally rather expensive in terms of Development Points for a Semi Spellcaster and such professions will learn them rather rarely, while most Arms professions find them daunting to learn.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

##### Open Spell Lists

Open spell lists involve the easiest concepts to mas -ter  in  each  realm  of  power,  although  dedication and research is required to learn their use. Any profession that has the realm of power as its own may learn the open lists of that realm. Hybrid Spellcasters may learn the Open spell lists associated with both of their two realms if they so desire. When an Arms User learns to use magic, it will normally be from an Open list.

<!-- image -->

##### Evil Spell Lists

Evil  spell  lists  are  included  for  evil  spell  users  in all  three  realms:  Channeling  (Section  6.7),  Essence (Section  7.7),  and  Mentalism  (Section  8.7).  These lists reflect the dark sides of Essence, Channeling and Mentalism. GMs should realize that this is a highly subjective and flexible concept and should reflect this in their world systems. This could range from an evil spell  user  being  perverted  and  manipulated  by  evil gods  and  power  sources  to  a  twisting  of  the  mind, madness, or the furthering of an alien agenda hostile to all mortal things. 'Evil' might well mean different things in the context of each realm of power. It should not merely reflect minimal effects like the disapproval of superstitious peasants. The addition of these spell lists  to  any  profession can significantly boost power levels,  so  giving  them  without  some  form  of  cost, problem, or penalty can affect game balance. An ex -ample of a method for handling Evil spell lists is given in Section 2.8.

If the GM allows Evil spell lists, he may make them available to be chosen as Base Lists (in place of any or all existing Base lists) and/or make them available as Closed lists. Any type of Spellcaster could potentially have access; however, the GM should be aware that for Semi Spellcasters the Evil Lists will generally be more powerful than their normal Base lists. The GM may even allow access to Evil spell lists to Arms Us -ers (in which case they are treated as Closed lists).

Hybrid Spellcasters may have access to Evil lists from either  or  both  of  their  realms. The  GM  must  decide for each such character if the character is linked to the 'Evil' of one or both realms. So a Sorcerer might have delved into books of evil in the forbidden library at the mages' guild allowing the Sorcerer to tap into a taint -ed  source  of  Essence,  or  alternatively,  the  Sorcerer may just have made a pact with a demon or dark god, giving him access to evil Channeling. Some hybrids may have been steeped in the Evil side of both realms; perhaps our hypothetical Evil Sorcerer delved the for -bidden library and in addition made a demonic pact, or made a pact with the god of dark magic, for instance.

#### 2.5. Spell Types

Each living or animate thing is surrounded by an aura, a personal field of Essence, which casters manipulate to create effects. This field also enables anything with an aura to resist magical effects. It is given flavor and intensity by factors like an individual's race and stats, which help explain characters' varying casting abili -ties and resistance to types of magic.

This aura is also why casters can use attack spells on beings, but cannot attack with utility spells, and why your personal gear resists with you, rather than being separately attacked by all effects. Since your clothing and gear is inside or in contact with your personal aura, it  receives  a  certain  amount  of  shelter  from  magical effects. This aura also explains why '1 target' effects like teleportation will grab not only the target, but also all of the target's clothing and equipment, rather than whisking the target off naked.

This protection works more for resistible effects than it does for physical effects generated by magic. So a caster cannot teleport a sword out of someone's hand, but can attempt to use telekinesis to wrench it away.

Spells  are  classified  by  type  to  determine  how  the spells are resolved. Resistance Rolls (RRs) are often used in spell resolution and are explained in Section 4.5.

##### Alchemical (A)

Alchemical spells are used in the creation of magical items,  as  covered  in Treasure  Law .  They  are  men -tioned here only for completeness, as this spell type does not appear in Spell Law .

##### Elemental (E)

Elemental spells are those in which the magic of the spell  creates,  summons,  and/or  manipulates  some real physical element which then has effects on other things, such as the target of a Fire Bolt. These typical -ly involve the six elements manipulated by Magicians: Cold/Ice, Earth, Fire, Light, Water, and Wind, but also include other elements, most notably the elements of sense involved in Essence illusions. Illusions are spells that create or manipulate a physical element perceived by one of the six senses used in Spell Law: sight, hear -ing, smell, taste, touch (i.e., feel), and Presence. (See Section 10.10 for a detailed treatment.)

Because the elements are simply real parts of the phys -ical world, rather than spell forces, their effects do not allow for RRs except in certain cases in order to avoid having the effect 'stick' to a target (Section 10.17).

##### Force (F)

These spells directly apply magical force to an object or being. Targets capable of resistance get an RR to avoid being affected. Targets do not get an RR for in -direct spell effects (e.g., if a Force spell is used to heat water that  someone later  jumps  into,  that  individual does not get an RR).

##### Informational (I)

Any spell marked as Informational is scrying or clairvoyance of some sort and falls into  a  gray  area  between non-attack and attack spells. (Spells that boost or  change  the  senses  of  the  caster  in  a  passive  way are 'U' type spells and are undetectable without using magical perception of some sort.) These spells only gather information, but often these spells will impact on other beings, either taking information from them,

or acting upon them in an indirect manner. When in -formational spells fail they can gather wrong or mis -leading information. To reflect this, the Gamemaster, rather than the Caster, should make the Spellcasting Roll.

Any being  that  is  a  target  of  an  informational  spell gets a Resistance Roll (only one per casting) with the results  as  shown  in  Table  2-5.  When  a  target  notic -es these effects due to an RR and feels the 'point of origin', this will only point out the caster if the spell is  directed specifically on the target (not the general area)  and  the  caster  is  visible  to  the  target.  So,  if  a caster is using Mind Scan on a target sitting at the next table, and the target makes the RR well enough, the target will know the effect is coming from the caster. If the caster is behind a wall or other obstruction, the feeling will just be 'Someone over there'. If the spell in question were Detect Mentalism, then the individu -al has not been targeted, he was simply in the area of effect, and while he can learn the general nature of the spell ('someone is detecting magic') if his RR is made by more than 50, the origin of the spell is not revealed.

Due to the large number of RRs that these spells can provoke, the GM may need to roll for groups of people or just use his judgment if an effect washes over large groups of people. In large cities with active groups of spell-casters, being an incidental target of an informa -tional  spell  may  be  common enough that it will not raise the suspicions of any but the most paranoid. In other  settings,  of  course,  being  caught  casting  any spell might result in one being hunted as a witch.

All beings and things leave traces of themselves be -hind  in  the  essence  field.  Certain  spells  read  these traces to gather information, allowing them to reveal the past. Targets observed through spells that tap into these residual traces do not get an RR. Likewise, there are  no  RRs  against  spells  that  look  into  the  future (though these have their own limitations). Only spells gathering information in the present allow for RRs.

Note that objects generally will not get RRs against Informational spells in any case, even magical items, with the exception of items with intelligence, which may offer resistance. Individual abilities of a magical item may be hidden; these get an RR to avoid detec -tion (see Attunement in TL Section 3.3).

##### Utility (U)

Utility spells generally only affect the caster, willing targets, non-magical objects (not inside the aura of an unwilling  living  being),  or  magical  items  inside  the aura of a willing target. If the target is unwilling, the spell fails. It is possible to lie or deceive in order to cast a U spell on someone. ('I'm going to heal that broken leg, Jim.') The caster's player may NOT declare what spell  is  being  cast  before  the  target  has  declared  to resist  or  not,  nor  may  the  target's  player  demand  to know what spell is being cast before deciding. It is an issue of trust; all U-type spells require the target to be willing.

Unconscious  or  sleeping  characters  should  be  as -sumed to be unwilling for all spells that do not spe -cifically describe sleeping or unconscious targets (i.e., Awaken), unless the caster is touching the target. If the caster is touching the target, then the target should be considered willing, unless the target has some phobia that would prevent him from ever willingly accepting a spell.

These types of spells can be extremely deadly when misused.  Look  at  the  Lofty  Bridge  list  and  then  at the  Crush  attack  table  (used  for  falling  damage)  for some good examples of why players should be careful about using the phrase 'Sure, I'm willing.' Teleport -ing straight up is an ugly way to discover that your friend,  the  Magician,  is  not  your  friend  any  more. Gamemasters should be wary of only asking players if they are willing when these types of spells will harm them, as this is a blatant tip off (and a common GMing mistake). Try and make 'Are you willing?' a routine question when someone is the target of a spell, except in cases of general trust (as may often be found among families or comrades at arms). If a magical object has had  its  powers  temporarily  neutralized,  it  is  at  the GM's discretion if this means a U type spell can now affect it.

Some spells may be marked with a lower case letter after the Spell Type indicating it is a special kind of spell.

Ball  or  Cone  (b): All  spells  marked  with  a  'b'  sub type are attack spells. They involve long-range area affect attacks, and casters may NOT develop Directed Spell skill for them. The OB used for these attacks is equal to the number of ranks that the caster has in the applicable Spell List.

Directed (d): All  spells  marked  with  a  'd'  sub  type are attack spells. They involve focused long-range at -tacks, and casters can develop Directed Spell skill for them (see RMCL Section 3.19).

Mental Attack (m): Any spells marked with an 'm' sub type are considered mental spells and are subject to  effects  and  defenses  that  target  mental  spells  or mind attacks. It should also be noted that these spells are ineffective against any creature or entity that does not have a 'mind' per se (i.e.,  plants,  at  least  some Undead, constructs, etc. -- the GM will have to deter -mine where the dividing line lies in the setting he is using).

Subconscious (s): A subconscious spell is a spell that is  triggered  when  certain  conditions  are  met.  Some of  the  triggering  conditions  are  obvious  (i.e.,  being stunned for Stun Relief spells or poisoned for Neutralize Poison spells or being injured for Unpain spells), while others are not (i.e., Awaken spells) and the trig -gering  conditions  may  actually  be  set  by  the  caster. Certain subconscious spells are also spells that require concentration. These spells will not trigger automati -cally unless the character is unconscious or asleep. So long as the caster is conscious, 'subconscious' spells can be cast normally, or even have a trigger cancelled (e.g., to conserve PP by avoiding casting a Stun Relief when danger has passed), by the conscious mind. (Note  that  Stun  Relief  spells  are  not  subject  to  any penalty for stun, as noted in Section 10.18.)

A  subconscious  mind  will  never  choose  to  rush  or overcast a spell (i.e., incur a penalty), but also ignores all penalties for not using free hands or use of voice. Subconscious spells with a 'C' duration will be auto -matically maintained for asleep or unconscious casters until they are no longer effective or the caster awakens

(e.g., a Regeneration spell will continue healing until the caster reaches full hits).

If more than one subconscious spell could go off in one round,  the  subconscious  will  always  choose  to  deal with the most life-threatening current condition first (if more than one seems equal, the order will go from highest  level  spell  to  lowest,  with  the  GM  deciding any ties). Thus,  the  subconscious  will  stop  bleeding before regenerating concussion hits, or cure poisoning before removing stun.

#### 2.6. Spell Parameters

In addition to Type, every spell in a list is given an area  of  effect,  duration,  and  range.  Furthermore  a handful of symbols are used in the spell lists which are described below:

- [RR Mod: #] - Any RRs against the effects of this spell are modified by #
* - Instantaneous; spell is cast as an instanta -neous action (see RMCL Section 8.1)
- - Spell does not require Power Points
- ‡ - Part of a set of spells that must be cast to -gether in order to be effective (or fully effective)

In all cases, 'varies' may appear as a parameter, when the parameter is treated in a complex way that needs to be explained in the spell description.

##### Area of Effect (AoE)

Area  of  Effect  lists  the  area  affected  by  the  spell; sometimes this is a physical area, sometime the limits of the spell are a little more abstract, specified in terms of targets, target levels, or even a number of attacks (for defensive spells), though in these cases, the spell range still acts as a limit on the physical reach of the spell.

Target :  The  term  'target(s)'  refers  to  the  being(s), animal(s), object(s), and/or material that a spell is at -tempting to affect. The spell description will state any restrictions on the target.

An area spell has a center of effect, and the center must lie within the range of the spell. If the center is at the extreme range of the spell, the effects of the spell will continue through the area of effect beyond the spell range.

##### Duration

Duration defines how long the spell effects last.

- C - Concentration required; see RMCL Section 8.1 for  details  on  concentrating,  and  the  fatigue  rules in RMCL Section  5.5  for  the  effects  of  extended concentration.
- duration - When a simple duration is listed, that is how long the spell effects last, unless cancelled or dispelled prior to the listed duration.
- duration  (C)  -  Concentration  is  required,  but  the period of concentration cannot exceed the duration given.  The  caster  can  stop  concentrating  and  the spell effect will stop; later, if the duration has not expired,  the  caster  can  concentrate  again  and  the spell effect will resume.
- P - Permanent; spell has a permanent effect in the sense of creating a 'permanent' physical or mental change.

A number of spells have a 'permanent' duration. Typically,  these  spells  deal  with  the  creation  of objects, substances, or effects. These durations are intended to indicate that a real, tangible object, sub -stance, or effect has been produced. These results (unless otherwise noted) are subject to the normal effects of time and the environment. For instance, a Wall of Ice is permanent in duration, but is still subject to melting or destruction. The same is true of healing spells; a wound might be healed, but the target is still subject to such wounds in the future. In some cases, such as curses, a continuing magi -cal effect lasts until it is removed in some way. In most cases,  it  should  be  quite  obvious  whether  a permanent  effect  is  continuing  magic  or  a  physi -cally  enduring  object  or  change.  For  example,  a permanent area of darkness is an on-going magical effect, as physical darkness would be removed by light.  Continuing  magic  is  subject  to  dispelling, permanent physical change is not. If there is a case where it is not obvious, the GM will have to make a  judgment.  Such  continuing  effects  are  subject to  normal  cancellation  by  the  caster  or  dispelling by another, whereas a permanent alteration of the mundane is not. Note that the creation of undead creatures should be considered to be a physical (al -beit unnatural) change. While the energies involved in sustaining unliving existence may be considered supernatural, they are of a different order than the spells that establish that existence in the first place. As such, undead may not be dispelled (although the mere flesh-puppets created by an Animated Dead spell may be).

- '-' - Instantaneous; spell's effect is instantaneously applied. Those effects are often themselves perma -nent.  For  example,  all  elemental  bolts  are  '-' duration spells, as the bolt travels very quickly to its target, but the damage that they do will last until healed.
- time/lvl - Duration is the time multiplied by the level of the caster.
- time/# fail - The duration of the spell's effect is based upon the difference between the target's Modified RR  and  the  minimum  roll  required  to  resist  the spell. The duration is equal to (this difference di -vided by #) and then multiplied by time. (See also Section 4.5, 'Resistance Rolls'.)

Duration = [(Minimum RR Required to Succeed - Modified RR) ÷ #] x time

Example: 1 rnd/10 fail would mean that an RR failure by 20 would have a 2 round effect (20/10 = 2, 2 x 1 = 2). Round up, so a fail by 12 on a 1 round/10 fail would also mean 2 rounds of effect.

##### Range

Range defines how far the spell can reach out in order to deliver its effects.

- self - Spell can only be cast on or can only be centered on the caster himself.
- touch - Caster must touch the target in order to create the effect.
- distance - Spell can take effect anywhere within this distance of the caster.
- distance/lvl - Spell can take effect anywhere within (distance) x (level) of the caster.
- &lt;distance&gt; - This indicates that the listed range is the Short Range for a Directed Spell's attack. This is the range over which the attack suffers no range penalty. Between this distance and twice that dis -tance is the Medium Range of this attack, in which it  suffers a -10 modification to OB. Further incre -ments  of  the  distance  give  Long  (-25),  Extreme (-50), and Absurd (-100) attack ranges. No attack beyond Absurd range is possible.

Normally, when a spell takes effect, the  target  must be  in  the  caster's  field  of  vision  or  sensed  by  some other means. This rule may be modified or changed by provisions in the specific spell descriptions.

2.7. sPell visiBility

Some spells  have  very  visible  effects  like  a  bolt  of fire springing forth from the caster's hand. However, except for such obvious spells, other than the gestures and incantations that are required for Channeling and Essence spells, spell casting normally has no visible effect.

Visible Effects for Spells

Most spells have some sort of visible side-effect: the area  around  the  caster's  hands  might  glow,  or  the target may give off a brief pulse of light. Spell cast -ers can make efforts to remain covert in casting, the easiest options being to cast from hiding or at long range or to use a distraction. One may also attempt to make one's spell-casting activity covert in practice (Section 4.2: Casting).

Different types of magic may all look the same, or may have different colors; this is the choice of the Gamemaster based on the setting. As an example, in Shadow World, Channeling comes in shades of green or gold, depending on the nature of the source. Hy -brid Spellcasters may have mixed threads or swirls of his realms.

Beyond the color, the visible effect may have a dif -ferent  intensity,  brightness,  or  pattern.  This  can  be used to reflect the power of the spell (so higher level spells  will  have  more  intense,  brighter  effects  than lower level spells) and possibly alignment, so spells cast by an Evil Spellcaster may be of a darker hue, or  mixed with black or darkness. Mentalism spells by  their  nature  have  little  visible  effect  other  than perhaps glowing eyes or a faint aura.

The spell's effect is only visible on the round of cast -ing, so an Essence illusion of a wall might look like a red glow spreading out from the caster into the shape of a wall on the round it is cast, but after that it will just look like a wall.

Example: If  Molnar  the  Magician  (Essence)  casts Sleep V on a group of guards, a wash of reddish light will come from his hands and settle onto the targets (guards). This is a low level spell, so it will be a dim effect. If Molnar was an Evil Magician, the red might be darker, or shot through with streaks or spots of darkness.

This option will serve to restrict spell-casting, espe -cially of the more subtle spells. Casting Sleep on a group of guards is much more effective in an envi -ronment where a guard who makes his RR may just think he has pulled too long a shift and his fellows are succumbing to a natural drowsiness, not to men -tion there being a lack of a light show that alerts the other guards eighty feet down the road at a different entrance.

#### 2.8. Customizing Magic

The possible variations on magic are boundless. This section  considers  some  of  the  primary  reasons  for changes  to  the  rules  as  presented  and  various  alter -ations that may be made to meet those demands. This treatment is far from exhaustive and GMs should not feel discouraged from making changes not mentioned.

It is necessary for this section to refer to various spells, spell lists, and mechanics introduced later in the text. The reader may wish to skip over this section on a first read, and will certainly do well to return to consider it after becoming fully acquainted with the unmodified magic system.

##### Changing Magic to Fit Setting

Not all forms of magic will be appropriate for a given setting. If gods and spirits strictly take no part in human affairs,  the  entire  Realm  of  Channeling  may be  inappropriate  for  use.  The  Ranger  could  then  be converted  to  an  Essence  Profession,  as  might  the Druid, while the Cleric and Paladin would probably have to be eliminated completely. A Realm, or simply certain Professions, may well be ruled out if one is at -tempting to convert Rolemaster to an existing setting. Many literary fantastic worlds have a narrower scope for  magic than does the Rolemaster system.  Certain spell effects may be ruled out by an established world setting or simply because they do not fit the campaign envisioned  by  the  Gamemaster.  If  the  campaign  is going to be centered around great journeys, the GM may eliminate teleportation effects (or at least the lon -ger-ranged ones) in order to prevent short cuts that by -pass that travel element. Subtracting various elements of the magic system is fairly easy. The only significant issue here is the potential loss of healing effects. Giv -en  the  deadliness  of  the  combat  system,  some  form of healing is of vital importance for all but the most non-violent of games. If magical healing is eliminated or significantly restricted, then there must be compen -sation elsewhere, or the game will become deadlier.

While many things can be done with the magic pre -sented here, the possibilities for spells are inexhaust -ible. If the Gamemaster finds that his setting requires additional  capabilities,  he  may  wish  to  create  spell lists that provide these capabilities. This is a more dif -ficult task than removing existing elements. Not only is  creating  additional spell lists  (or  even  whole Pro -fessions) more work than deciding to simply not use all of those provided, the GM must be aware of game balance issues. Spells should be kept of an appropriate power for their level and the type of spell list on which they appear.

Rearrangement of existing elements is also possible. For example, a GM might feel that Druids and Rangers draw their power from Nature itself, rather than from nature gods or spirits, and that this corresponds better to  the  description  of  Essence  than  Channeling. This GM will move Druids and Rangers from the Realm of Channeling to that of Essence. He might also feel that Bardic magic is better explained as inspired by the Muses and move the Bard to the Realm of Channel -ing. In other cases, a GM might feel that a given spell list would fit better in a different Realm than the one given here. It is also possible that a Gamemaster will find that given the way that he runs his game, a spell list  is  more  or  less  powerful  in  that  particular  game than we have judged. Thus a Closed spell list might be changed to an Open list or vice versa.

Further  modifications  are  possible.  Details  are  dis -cussed below that can be adjusted for the setting or varied  between  cultures  in  order  to  help  distinguish magical traditions of different peoples.

##### Adding Flavor to Magic

This section contains some guidelines for Gamemas -ters on adding a bit more excitement and diversity to their game without changing any of the mechanics of spell-casting.

One of the simplest things to do is to rename spell lists (or individual spells) to reflect overall setting or spe -cific cultures. A pretentious group of Magicians might learn 'The Secret Ways of the Flame' instead of 'Fire Law'. A magent's organization might consider it more politic to teach 'Living Asset Reclassification' rather than 'Assassination Mastery', while another with an organized crime focus might know it as 'Whacking Ways'. In particular, various cultures may give unique names to lists  with  religious  significance. This  does not necessarily mean Channeling spells. It means that if the Sea God Tyuio is very important, 'Water Law' may become 'Tyuio's Blessings'. Other possibilities include cultures where the lists are named for those important in developing them. or important for giving large grants to the College of Imperial Wizardry.

Looking at the spell lists, you have lots of effects and parameters, so it would seem like a Fire Bolt or Light spell cast by any caster would appear identical to the same spell cast by another caster, with the only dif -ferences being due to caster level. But with a bit of work, you can almost make the same spell cast by two different casters seem like completely different spells. Much of the flavor of spell casting comes in how the

Gamemaster or the players describe casting, and the effects. By varying the descriptions of the effects, and always describing casting and spells in terms of what the  characters  experience,  a  GM  makes  magic  far more interesting than just calling off the spell name and giving a dry reading of the attack table and critical results.

Compare these descriptions:

'The Mad Magician Mellus casts a Fire Bolt at Julian. It hits for 17D Heat, the crit roll is an 88. 'Blood boils and vessels burst in arm.' Julian takes an additional two hits, is bleeding six per round, has a -25 penalty, and is stunned for two rounds.'

'The Mad Magician Mellus shouts out a guttural word and points her hand at Julian, and fire lances out from her fingers. Julian raises his arm to cover his face be -fore the flames burn it off, but at a terrible price. The bolt of flame boils the blood in Julian's arm, causing it  to  burst  through  scorched  flesh.  The  brief  roar  of the flame is drowned out by Julian's agonized scream. Julian takes 19 hits, is stunned for 2 rounds, is at -25 to all actions, and his whole arm is spurting out six hits worth of blood each round.'

'The Mad Magician Mellus points her palm at Julian, exposing a tattoo of a snake, the head resting on her

<!-- image -->

palm, the body winding around her wrist and disap -pearing up the sleeve of her robes. She utters a sibilant hiss and the tattoo seems to jump off of her hand in the form of a flaming green snake, streaking forward in a serpentine path toward Julian. Julian raises his arms to shield his face, and the flaming snake coils around his right arm, rearing free and then striking several times, leaving burnt patches where blood boils through. Ju -lian screams just as the snake of fire fades away in a wisp of smoke. Julian takes 19 hits, is stunned for 2 rounds, is at -25 to all actions, and six hits of precious life-giving blood are fleeing his body every round.'

Likewise, compare these descriptions for a less flashy spell:

'Aladin  the  Paladin  casts  Heal  IV  on  Julian.  Julian recovers 20 hits.'

'Aladin the Paladin places his hand on Julian's fore -head,  softly  reciting  the  Blessing  of  the  Wounded. Julian feels the throbbing pain in his arm fade as he recovers 20 hits.'

'Reaching  towards  the  heavens, Aladin  the  Paladin calls  for  aid  in  the  vowel-rich  sacred  tongue  of  his faith.  With  a  far-off  look  in  his  eyes,  he  lowers  his hands to gently stroke Julian's wound. As a comfort -ing warmth spreads through the affected area, Julian recovers 20 hits.'

All three of those describe exactly the same effects in different manners. If a Gamemaster is creative enough, he should not be surprised if the players actually think completely new and different spells are being used. As long as the mechanics and effects of casting remain unchanged, there is no risk of skewing game balance, but everyone will find they are having a better time, and things will remain fresh and exciting far longer.

It is best to put some thought into this ahead of time, as opposed to bogging down game play trying to think these things up on the fly, but you generally can get these kinds of results with just a few basic ideas, and then applying them imaginatively.

Casting takes a certain amount of time and may require gestures or incantations. None of the details are speci -fied. Is the caster chanting out boldly declared words, or are they soft? Is casting done in the caster's native tongue, in a traditional ancient language, or a special language specific to spell-casting? Are the words al -ways exactly the same, or are they adjusted for con -text? Is the gesture just pointing a finger, complicated hand weaving, or a little dance? Does the caster's hair stand up while the room fills with the smell of ozone? Does hellfire crackle in the caster's eyes?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Form : Is the Fire Bolt a tiny ball of fire, a stream of fire,  a  flaming snake? What color is it? How does it move?

Sound : Does the Fire Bolt hiss and crackle like flame, scream like a tortured soul, roar like a beast? When it strikes does it explode with a pop or boom, or does it sizzle?

Feel :  Other  senses  may  be  involved,  how  does  the spell smell, taste, or feel? An Utterlight spell cast by a Cleric of a truth god may be a cool white light that feels  like  it  shines  right  through  you,  shining  onto your soul, while the same Utterlight spell cast by the Cleric of a sun god might feel exactly like sunlight, warm on the skin.

Involving players in customizing the effects of their spells can often get them more attuned to their charac -ters, and certain in-game elements might be tied into the flavor of spells. For instance, casting a Fire Bolt that  looks  like  a  flaming  snake  may  be  a  signature of a magician trained at the Red Tower of Serpents. This may allow the Gamemaster to include clues or campaign information just in the way spells are de -scribed. Such default appearances are always subject to modification through Spell Mastery (Section 4.6), and in some cases, the spells may specify a few details of how they manifest.

##### Tweaking the Mechanics

In some cases, simply changing superficial appearanc -es  or  changing  the  available  spell  lists,  Professions, and/or Realms may not be sufficient for the effect that the  GM  desires.  There  may  be  very  specific  details of the setting that require changing the mechanics of spell-casting. When actually changing the rules used for running the game, care must always be used, but game balance is not made out of glass and Gamemasters should not be afraid to experiment.

A simple example of a change to mechanics might be the case of a GM who wants to emphasize that magic is more spiritual than physical in its power. This GM therefore  decides  to  eliminate  the  RR  modifiers  for range. The modifiers for range are kept for Directed Spell attacks because these are modifiers for the phys -ical effects invoked by the magic.

More complex examples would involve serious differ -ences in the way magic works in a universal sense or they may be used to make different magical traditions more distinct than is possible by merely changing the way in which they are described. The Bard's 'Song' lists (see Section 10.1 for the details of their operation) are  an  example  of  how  spell-casting  can  be  made  a richer, more complex experience. The cost, however, is more dice-rolling, more rules, and a bit more time spent  in  resolving  effects.  One  also  needs  to  ensure that there are both costs and benefits.

Another example of a possible spell-casting tradition would be one in which 'Blood Mages' invested their spells  with  the  power  of  their  own  blood.  Casting  a spell  would  require  a  caster  to  shed  his  own  blood (taking perhaps hits equal to the spell level or perhaps a more random 1d10 hits) each time he casts a spell. If unable to shed blood, he would be unable to cast spells at all. In compensation for this investment, the Blood Mage's spells are harder to resist (a fixed RR penalty or  possibly  one  based  on  the  caster's  Body  Devel -opment  ranks  or  Constitution).  Such  a  spell-casting tradition might be limited to a single Profession or it might be used by all casters of a given culture.

Example: Wand-based casting

As an example of revising the rules in order to fit a setting concept, consider a GM who wants to have a world in which wands play a part as basic spell-casting gear, rather than simply as items for casting embedded spells.  He creates a homemade table of wand types, consisting of a base wood and a metal tip, with rarer and more expensive elements producing better results. The wand modifies all SCRs and the casting level of the spell itself.

Putting together a superior wand offers a fairly easy way to stack up some bonuses, but the wand makes

Considering further rules needed in this environment, the GM decides that it takes time to adjust to a new wand, so imposes a -30 penalty for using a new wand, reducing the penalty by -1 for each day with the wand. The 'Hands' section of Table 4-1 is reinterpreted as 'hands on the wand'. The wands are used by all Es -sence casters, while a similar treatment of 'holy sym -bols' is applied to Channeling users. Waving around an item is not such a good fit for Mentalism, so while the GM again applies his table to crystals (with sizable jewels as the best versions), Mentalism users are only expected to wear their crystals, not present them. To ensure that spell-casters  are  not  completely  crippled (just  mostly  crippled)  without  their  focus  items,  the GM determines that casting without a wand (or holy symbol or crystal, as appropriate) is at -20 to the SCR and the caster is treated as being only half his actual level (round up).

Another GM, desiring a more elaborate form of such a system, creates more extensive tables, varying more elements (e.g., effects might differ according to spell Type), and using many more different types of items based  on  profession,  race,  and/or  culture,  including hats,  staves,  wands,  tools,  athames,  banners,  feath -ers, bells, and much more. It requires a good deal of bookkeeping, but provides flavor and rewards player pursuit  of  specific  items  and  experimentation  with possible new variants.

Example: Handling Evil spell lists

One area where the GM is expected to provide some customization is in the handling of the Evil spell lists, as  the  treatment  of  'Evil'  can  be  highly  setting-de -pendent. One method to handle the Evil spell lists is to treat them as morally corrupting in the manner that follows. Each of the Evil lists is linked to a specific vice: greed, cowardice, disloyalty, spite, etc. Each list might  be  constantly  tied  to  a  particular  vice:  Dark -ness  to  dishonesty,  Essence  Twisting  to  arrogance, Disease to slovenliness, and so on. Alternatively, the associations might vary from individual to individual, with Faceless Jack becoming vain from his studies of Demonic Pacts, while his rival Mary Malice suffers gluttony as a result of learning that same list. When -ever an opportunity arises to express one of the vices that  the  character  has  as  a  result  of  delving  into  the

Dark Arts, but the player of that character (or the GM on behalf of an NPC) wishes to declare some other action  that  does  not  express  that  vice,  the  character must make an RR (modified only by SD bonus and, possibly, circumstances) against the corrupting effect of the relevant list (treat ranks in the list as the level of the 'attack') or act according to that vice instead.

Example: Mary Malice has arrived at Faceless Jack's home in order to bring a swift and violent end to their rivalry. As she passes through the dining hall, she spies a cake on the table. This is a temptation to her gluttony. Her player does not want her distracted from her mission, however, and also suspects that Jack might have left out a poisoned cake if he learned she was coming. Mary is 9th level and has an SD bonus of +4. She has 8 ranks in Demonic Pacts. Mary rolls a 61, for a modified RR of 61+4+2x(9-8) = 67. Mary continues and finds Faceless Jack, who is disappointed that his poisoned cake trick failed. Jack runs from Mary, who pursues. No match for Mary in personal combat, Jack wants to get away. Unfortunately, he passes one of his full-length mirrors (Jack is 7th level and has an SD bonus of -1. He has 7 ranks in Demonic Pacts. Jack rolls a 14, for a modified RR of 141+2x(7-7) = 13) and stops to admire himself, giving Mary the chance to catch him. Melee ensues. Note that the GM might have given Mary a bonus to her RR for her suspicion that Jack might have poisoned it.
