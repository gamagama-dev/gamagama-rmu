### 5. Magical Rituals

The normal method of spell casting is very tactical, using quick techniques to gather, focus, and structure magical  energies  to  create  a  set  effect.  Outside  of combat,  it  is  quite  normal  to  use  methods  that  take more time and use additional resources in order to get results  of  greater  scope  or  power.  It  is  also  possible to use Magical Ritual in order to achieve effects that the caster(s) would not otherwise have access to (i.e., casting spells that have not been learned).

The Magical Ritual skill is actually a number of dif -ferent skills dealing with rituals of different types. If more than one skill applies to a particular ritual, use the character's best applicable Magical Ritual skill for the maneuver roll. The Magical Ritual skills are: Al -teration, Creation, Defensive, Destruction, Elemental, Healing, Informational, and Summoning &amp; Transpor -tation.

Alteration : Rituals of Alteration deal in changing the appearance, form, nature, or substance of a physical or spiritual thing. This includes shape-changing, Glamours , and mental influence. It does not include any act of creation, destruction, or restoration.

Creation :  Rituals of Creation deal in the production of permanent or temporary things. It does not apply to things that are only momentary, such as a Fire Bolt or similar elemental attacks. This category includes Wall spells, illusions and phantasms, the Creations list, and Symbols.

Defensive :  Defensive  Rituals  deal  with  powers  of avoidance,  deflection,  or  resistance  of  harm.  They include spells granting defensive (RR, DB) bonuses, spells providing improved Armor Type, and spells that block attacks.

Destruction :  Rituals  of  Destruction  deal  in  direct destruction.  They  include  most  Sorcerer  spells,  dis -pelling, and Repel Undead spells. They do not include spells that create elemental material which then causes damage, it relates to magic effects that directly dam -age or disrupt the target.

Elemental : Elemental Rituals are those that deal with the six elemental types known to the Magician: Earth, Fire, Ice, Light, Water, and Wind, as well as the more general 'elemental' powers of weather generally.

Healing :  Healing  Rituals  deal  in  powers  of  resto -ration. Most commonly, these will involve the healing of broken bodies, but this category of ritual includes the mending of broken minds and spirits, the mending of the sundered bond between body and soul (and thus Lifegiving ),  and the mending of damaged non-living objects.

Informational :  Informational  Rituals  deal  with  in -formation, either gathering it or transmitting it. This includes  sense  augmentation  (e.g., Nightvision ),  de -tections,  divination,  delving,  analyses,  and  spells  of communication.

Summoning  &amp;  Transportation :  These  rituals  deal with movement, be it at a slow pace or instant trans -ference.  This  includes  inter-dimensional  movement and so covers the summoning of demons and others not native to the mortal world. Spells allowing one to fly or walk on ceilings, spells of creature summoning, and teleportation effects all fall within this category.

For the wielder of Channeling or Essence, Magical Rit -uals are much like longer, more extravagant versions of spell-casting, with broader gestures, paraphernalia, long invocations of power, etc. A Mentalist will not simply sit and meditate for a magical ritual. The forms he uses will be bent more to assist in focusing his own mind, but he too will want his hands available to ma -nipulate  his  ritual  implements  (crystal  ball,  divining rod, Tarot deck, abacus, etc.) and his voice to chant. Ultimately, to have more powerful effects, you need to draw and manipulate external Essence (which is why multiple realms can contribute PP to a single ritual), the  realm  difference  is  in  what  internal  power  you use to fuel the initial process. It requires at least three minutes to perform a Magical Ritual and adequate PP must be spent to power the spell(s) to be duplicated, though these are minimal requirements and are often exceeded.

If you use the option where all spell-casting is visible, Magical Rituals should have spectacular visual effects accompanying them.

#### 5.1. Casting Ritual Spells

There are three types of participants in Magical Ritu -als. The only one that is required is the primary caster, whose Magical Ritual maneuver roll determines the success or failure of the endeavor. The casting level of the resulting spell effect is based on the primary caster. There are also  two  types  of  helpers  for  the  primary caster. A  major  contributor  may  provide  PP  without limit, shares in any results of spell failure should the ritual go wrong, and can use his own Magical Ritual skill, with the applicable specialization, to supplement the  primary  caster's  own,  using  the  complementary skills rules in RMCL Chapter 5. The major contribu -tors assist in actually casting the ritual magic. A minor contributor may only add PP, limited to one PP rank in Magical Ritual (any specialization). A minor contribu -tor does not normally suffer spell failure results if the ritual goes wrong, nor does he assist in the actual cast -ing. There may be other individuals dancing around, chanting, or howling as the primary caster performs blood  sacrifice,  but  if  they  lack  the  Magical  Ritual skill, they can be nothing but set dressing.

The  primary caster and major contributors  may supplement  their  Magical  Ritual  skill  with  certain additional  skills  at  the  GM's  discretion. Acrobatics, Music, certain Languages, Religion, or a skill related to the desired effect would be typical skills allowed. One skill may apply for each individual and these are treated as a fresh set of complementary skills (the first adds its  ranks,  the  second  half  its  ranks,  and  so  on, independent of  the  additions  for  major  contributors' Magical Ritual skill). A minor contributor may use a 'charge' from a Spell Adder to make his PP contribu -tion. A major contributor or even the primary caster may do so as well, although then the PP contribution will be equal to his ranks in Magical Ritual. PP from all three Realms may be incorporated into the ritual, but there is some difficulty involved.

In addition to the skill of the primary caster (and pos -sible assistance from the major contributors), there are many other modifications to the maneuver as shown in Table 5-1a. More than one spell may be combined in  a  ritual's  effect  (e.g.,  the  ritual  might  cast  both  a Rune spell and a spell to be stored in the rune). If this

is  done,  combine the levels of the spells to determine the spell level to use for the 'relative level' modifier, as well as applying all other modi -fiers for each spell, including a -25 penalty  for  each  spell  included  in the ritual effect after the first.

The auspicious/inauspicious factors may be worked out in some detail by GMs who desire to use them for enhanced flavor in the magical arts, but they may also be kept as a tool to encourage or discourage certain rituals.

##### Investments

The casters  can  invest  more  power  or  time  into  the ritual to increase the chance of success as shown on Tables 5-1b and 5-1c. Spending more time helps, but while the ritual power will provide for bodily needs, fatigue  becomes  a  factor,  as  each  time  mark  is  met after  a  certain  point,  the  primary  caster  and  major contributors must make Endurance rolls. Minor con -tributors do not need to make such checks as they can take breaks whenever they want. In fact, after adding their PP contribution, they are free to fight off the at -tackers who want to disrupt the ritual. While engaged in the ritual, the primary caster and major contributors are sustained through the power of the ritual. Except for  the  required  Endurance  rolls,  they  have  no  need for rest or sleep, food, or drink. However, any fatigue penalties from before the ritual begins will not recover until the ritual concludes.

There is also the possibility of 'investment of blood', shown on Table 5-1d. This can be either in the form of  concussion  hits  taken  (careful  bleeding  or  other

ritualistic  damage),  which  will  be  done  towards  the beginning  of  the  ritual,  but  will  not  take  effect  (no penalties for low hits, nor unconsciousness nor even death) until the ritual is over. The more dramatic case is the taking of a critical, generally riskier. This is done at a spectacular finale to the ritual, and might take the form of a fire cult's leader throwing himself through roaring  flame.  Damage  is  taken  immediately,  but  at this  point  the  ritual  is  complete  and  even  death  will not prevent the Magical Ritual maneuver from being made and the spell (if the roll is successful) will be cast. Only the primary caster and major contributors may provide 'investment of blood'. If more than one contributes hits to the ritual, total the hit loss and use that to determine the bonus (e.g., four individuals tak -ing 1d10 hits each is not 4 x +5, but a total of 4d10 hits  for  a  +15  bonus).  Critical  damage  may  be  split up between multiple individuals, but cannot exceed a +100 bonus in total.

So, to cast a ritual over three days, the primary cast -er and major participants must make four Endurance rolls: two Routine, one Easy, and one Medium. If the primary caster fails, the ritual fails (no effect, do not roll for spell failure) immediately. If a major participant fails, the ritual may continue, but any skill con -tributions (not PP investment or hits of blood invest -ment) from that participant are lost.

##### Ritual Items

Various tools and fixtures are used in magical rituals. These  can  be  general  ritualistic  items  such  as  ritual attire, staves, wands, athames, holy symbols, and crys -tals.  They  can  be  more  focused  on  a  type  of  effect, like  a  large  mirror  for  scrying  or  a  voodoo  doll  for harming a target. They can be quite specific, such as an  engraved  circle  for  summoning  a  particular  type of demon or a statuette of a particular individual for spells targeting that one person. Ritual magic also uses materials  in  spell-casting  that  are  consumed  in  the casting, such as sacrifices, candles, bonfires, powders, potions, herbs, etc.

Proportional Appropriateness Bonus

Instead of a fixed bonus, increase the bonus value by 50% for a 'broadly appropriate item' and by 100% for a 'specifically appropriate item'.

For purposes of evaluating the bonus as a ritual item, the  value  of  non-expended  items  does  not  include value due to enchantment. Note that an item may be both appropriate for general use and as a more focused item. Any  wand  will  do  for  general  use,  but  if  that wand happens to be made of sugar maple wood and the spell in question is an illusion of a sweet taste, it would be considered specifically appropriate.

If  multiple  items  will  be  used,  add  up  the  total  val -ue of all tools (items which will not be consumed or expended) and the total value of all sacrifices and ex -pended components before consulting Table 5-1e for the applicable bonuses.

Table 5-1e: Ritual Items

| Cost of tools/ fixtures   |   Bonus* | Value of sacrifice or expended component   |
|---------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| <10 gp                    |        0 | <1 sp                                      |
| 10 gp                     |       +5 | 1 sp                                       |
| 100 gp                    |      +10 | 10 sp                                      |
| 1,000 gp                  |      +15 | 100 sp                                     |
| 10,000 gp                 |      +20 | 1,000 sp                                   |
| 100,000 gp                |      +25 | 10,000 sp                                  |
| 1,000,000 gp              |      +30 | 100,000 sp                                 |
| 10,000,000 gp             |      +35 | 1,000,000 sp                               |

The pattern continues, but it is a rare Dark Lord who can afford to blow more than a million on ritual supplies.

* - Bonus is for a generally appropriate (set of) item(s). If the materials are considered less than ideal, but the GM is willing to accept them (e.g., use of a silver wand while attempting to charm a werewolf), the bonus is reduced by 5. For a broadly appropriate item, add 5 to the bonus. For a specifically appropriate item, add 10 to the bonus.

#### 5.2. Extension of Spell Parameters

Rituals may adjust the parameters of a spell effect, as summarized on Table 5-2.

Some  spells  have  a  weight  limit  restriction,  which may be modified through ritual casting.

If a spell does a critical of a fixed type, it may be en -hanced. Spells that inflict concussion hits of damage or heal concussion hits, including the concussion hit damage  from  elemental  spells,  may  have  those  hits multiplied.

Area of Effect may be increased. It may also be de -creased, which will modify the roll by -10, no matter how much the spell is minimized. Note that doubling a radius quadruples the area, so doubling a radius is ac -tually -40. If the Area of Effect is a number of targets or levels, this may doubled in the same way.

The effects of a 'Self' spell can be so increased, but only major participants in the ritual may be included in the increased number of targets.

Range and Duration may both be increased, as shown on Table 5-2.

| Table 5-2: Spell Parameters Parameters       | Modifier   |
|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Each doubling of weight limit                | -10        |
| Each step crit is altered (e.g. Ato B)       | -30        |
| x2 hits inflicted/healed                     | -10        |
| x3 hits inflicted/healed                     | -20        |
| x4 hits inflicted/healed                     | -30        |
| x5 hits inflicted/healed                     | -40 max.   |
| Decreasing Area of Effect                    | -10 max.   |
| Increasing Area of Effect, for each doubling | -20        |
| Increase Spell range, for each doubling      | -15        |
| Spell Duration                               |            |
| From no duration to 1 round                  | -50        |
| From 'concentration' to '1 rnd/lvl (C)'      | -20        |
| To remove a '(C)' limitation                 | -25        |
| For each step change of time duration        | -20        |

Note that removing the concentration requirement will not make sense for some spells, as where concentra -tion is required to change exact effects. The primary caster or any major participants may fulfill any con -centration requirements (and they may transfer control of  the  effects  from  one  to  another  with  a  successful Very Hard Mental Focus maneuver by each).

Beyond that, each step increase in duration provides a -20 modification. The steps are as follows, with any 'per level' remaining part of the equation:

- 1 round
- 1 minute
- 10 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- 1 day
- 1 week
- 1 month
- 1 year
- 1 decade
- 1 century
- 1 millennium
-  Permanent

#### 5.3. Ritual Resolution

Once the modifiers are determined, the maneuver can be rolled and the results applied as listed in Table 5-3. If the ritual is resistable (e.g., it has the effect of a Type F spell), treat the SCR as 50, with the primary ritual -ist's level as the attack level.

Example: Marvin the Magician's best friend, Robbie the Rogue, is bleeding at 3 hits/round and no medical skill has availed to stop it. Unwilling to try cauterization with his low Medicine skill, Marvin opts to attempt a ritual cure. Since Robbie is bleeding out at 36 hits per minute, by the time Marvin has spent the minimal three minutes on ritual casting, Robbie will have taken an additional 108 hits and died, so the result of the Ritual Magic maneuver will not matter to Robbie.

Magical Ritual is the wrong skill to attempt when you are in an urgent situation.

Example: John has a fractured bone of Medium Severity. Not in danger of imminent death, but in need of healing and lacking a trained physician, he is a more suitable target for a healing ritual.

John's friend Gavin the Good is a 5th level Mentalist with 5 ranks in Magical Ritual: Healing. He has Magical Ritual as a Professional skill and applicable stat bonuses of +9 (+4 Pr realm stat and +1 Me), so his basic bonus for this skill is 25+5+9 = +39. He is not nearly good enough to attempt anything outside his own realm, so he opts for the still risky use of another profession' s base list. The third level spell on the Lay Healer base list Bone Mastery will do the job. This is two levels below Gavin's own level (+2), but Gavin does not know the list (-50) and it is the base list of another profession (-40). The GM thinks the players have been too casual about preparing for such emergencies, so no auspicious circumstances are lending a hand. The modification to the maneuver begins at +39+2-5040 = -49. Gavin needs to find some bonuses if he is going to have a chance of success.

Gavin has 76 PP. The spell he is trying to cast requires 3 PP. Gavin decides to go all out on power and throws in another 64 PP (+8 2 PP) for a +(3x8) = +24 bonus, leaving himself with 9 PP in reserve and a total -25 modifier to his maneuver. Gavin does not want to risk failing an Endurance roll, so he will take four hours to conduct his ritual, for +25. He also has a 5 gp crystal pendant that acts as a general ritual item for a +5 bonus. Gritting his teeth, Gavin invests 4d10 hits in his own blood. He lucks out, only losing 16 hits for his +15 bonus. Finally, he burns a piece of rare 'bonewood', noted for its bonelike color. This costs 12 sp and is ruled specifically appropriate, for another +20. Gavin has improved his situation to a -25+25+5+15+20 = +40 modifier.

Gavin rolls a 59, for a final result of 99. John' s bone is properly treated and will begin the recovery process, but Gavin must roll on the spell failure table to see if some unpleasant side effect will add to his difficulties. A roll of 72 for a Mentalism utility spell just indicates failure of the spell, which does not apply in this instance. All Gavin has lost is his afternoon, most of his PP, a somewhat pricy piece of wood, and 16 hits. A small price to pay for mending his friend, but Gavin and John agree to either find a real healer to accompany them in the future or to start putting some DP into the Medicine skill.

Restricting Magical Rituals

Some Gamemasters may wish to restrict the use of Magical Rituals in their campaign.  Some examples of these limitations could be requiring the caster to know the spell list from which the spell is cast (or at least a related list) or to possess a Book of Rituals or a specific scroll.  A book could contain a whole set of related spell lists from which ritual spells could be cast, whilst a scroll might just contain one.

Using this option will of course reduce the usefulness of the Ritual Magic skills and so should be decided upon at the outset of the campaign.
