### 1.1. Rolemaster

Rolemaster is  a  revision  of  Iron  Crown  Enterprise's original Rolemaster game system published in 1982. Rolemaster was  originally  designed  to  be  used  as  a complete fantasy role-playing (FRP) system or as in -dividual modular components. This new version is no different, providing a modular and easy to modify core system that can be built upon to create a detailed RPG rule set for any setting. There are five core books:

Rolemaster Core Law (RMCL) contains all the core rules in three parts. Character Law contains a set of rules for creating rich and detailed characters with a complete and comprehensive skill system, as well as optional talents that can be used to enrich characters further. Arms Law contains rules for tactical combat amongst individuals and small groups using a detailed simulation of weapons and armor. Its combat system covers  the  mechanics  of  attacks  from  weapons  and animals  to  elemental  attacks.  Colorful  critical  and fumble  results  make  every  combat  interesting  and memorable. Gamemaster Law offers helpful guidance to  Gamemasters, as well as rules and guidelines for adding setting rules such as creating races, cultures, and  professions.  Poison,  disease,  and  other  hazards that may come up in play are also covered.

Creature  Law  (CL) contains  stats  for  hundreds  of animals, monsters, and fantastical creatures. Creature Law will be released in two volumes. As fantasy settings are often home to a variety of beasts, Creature Law II contains rules  for  creating  new  monsters  for new and unusual settings.

Spell Law (SL) is a magic system with thousands of spells organized into three realms of magic. This pro -vides characters with a wide variety of spell-using op -tions for all types of professions. Spells are organized into lists, which are related in theme.

Treasure Law (TL) is a book of treasure, equipment and commerce, an important part of any RPG. Rules for crafting mundane objects as well as magical items are included along with the Alchemist professions.

#### Die Rolls

1-10 (1d10): Roll one ten-sided die to obtain a result between 1 and 10. If the dice are numbered 0-9 rather than 1-10, treat results of 0 as 10. Occasionally other types of dice will be referenced (e.g., 1d6 for a six-sided die). If the appropriate type of die is not available, roll a ten-sided die and reroll any result outside the specified range (e.g., for a 1d6, reroll any result above 6).

2-20 (2d10) : Roll two ten-sided dice and add the two results  to  obtain  a  result  between  2  and  20.  Initiative uses this type of roll.

1-100 (d100) : Rolemaster primarily uses two 10-sided dice to get a result between 1 and 100, referred to as 'percentiles'. Each of the 10-sided dice gives a result between 0 and 9 - one die is treated as the 'tens' die and the other as the 'ones' die. These may be distin -guished  by  color  or  other  marking  (in  which  case  it must be made clear which die is to be read as the tens before rolling; a fixed convention for your gaming table is recommended), or one may use a pair of percentile dice where one is marked '10, 20, 30, ... , 00'. (It is also  possible  to  roll  a  novelty  hundred-sided  die,  but most  gamers  find  these  impractical.)  Thus  a  random result between 01 and 100 (a '00' is treated as 100) is obtained. d100 rolls are used primarily for rolls on the critical and fumble tables.

1-100  Open-ended  (d100OE) :  An  open-ended  roll means that there is no absolute minimum or maximum. First make a 1-100 roll; a roll of 96-00 indicates that the dice are rolled again and the result added to the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and added, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the open-ended roll.

If the first roll is a 01-05 the dice are rolled again and the result subtracted from the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and subtracted, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total of these rolls is the result of the low open-ended roll. A roll of 01-05 on anything other than the first roll does not cause one to roll again.

Example: The GM asks a player to make an open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 99 (thus between 96 and 100). A second roll is made with a result of 96, so a third roll is made with a result of 04. Thus, the open-ended roll that the GM requested is a 199 (= 99 + 96 + 04).

Example: The GM asks a player to make an open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 04 (thus between 01 and 05). A second roll is made with a result of 97 (thus between 96 and 00), so a third roll is made, resulting in a 03. Thus, the open-ended roll that the GM requested is a -96 (= 04 - 97 - 03).

In some cases, the roll is only open-ended at the high end (rolls of 96-00), but results at the low end are not open-ended  as  some  other  mechanic  is  used  for  low rolls. The most common case is attack rolls, where low unmodified rolls indicate a fumble.

##### Unmodified Rolls (UM)

Certain  results  on  some  rolls  indicate  an  immediate effect and no modifications are considered. These rolls are marked with a 'UM', such as '01-04 UM'. For ex -ample, all weapon attacks result in a fumble if the initial unmodified d100OE roll falls within the fumble range of the weapon. If a roll falls into the UM range, then no modifiers are applied to the roll and the unmodified result  is  applied  (such  as  a  fumble).  When  resolving absolute  maneuvers  (see  Maneuvers,  below),  an  un -modified roll of 66 results in an unusual event. Success or failure is resolved normally with all modifications, but the outcome will be unusual in some way or have unexpected side effects.

Optional Rules

In  these  rules,  you  will  see  rules  separated  out  in boxed text, like the box this text is in. Boxed rules are optional or advanced rules, you can ignore them if you choose and the rules will work fine as is. These rules apply or do not apply at the GM's discretion, so if you are a player ask the GM if any particular boxed text rule is being used.

##### Power Level

Rolemaster is  a  very open role-playing game, and is built that way on purpose to allow for a wide variety of gaming experiences to be possible within the rules. Power  level  can  vary  widely  between  two  gaming groups, or even between two different campaigns run by the same GM. Rule elements may be over-powered and game breaking in one campaign, but necessary or even casual elements in another campaign. In order to allow for a broad range of power levels, power levels are used in some sections of the rules to identify more powerful  elements,  to  help  GMs  decide  what  they want to allow in play. The GM may even decide to use different  power levels in different parts of the rules, such  as  using  a  Heroic  power  level  for  generating characters but an Average power level when dealing with magic.

In Spell Law , power level is used only for the guide -

lines  for  availability  of  spell  lists  (see  Section  3.1). There  are,  however,  a  number  of  optional  rules  of -fered, each of which has implications for the power of spellcasters. Additionally, individual GMs may make their  own  modifications  to  meet  balance  or  setting needs  in  their  own  campaigns.  Some  discussion  of these possibilities is offered in Section 2.8. Guidance is offered regarding game balance issues involved in various options, but such advice is necessarily general and must be interpreted in the context of your partic -ular campaign.

#### 1.2. The Basics

One of the basic aspects of this system is the use of spell lists and experience levels (or just levels). The ability to cast and learn spells is closely tied to a char -acter's level.

Spells are grouped into lists. A spell list is an ordering of spells based upon the correlation of level, intricacy, and potency. All spells in a list have common charac -teristics and attributes, although each may have vastly different effects and applications.

Spell lists are grouped into categories based upon professions and realms of power (Channeling, Essence, and Mentalism). There are 171 spell lists divided into:

-  15 sets of professional 'base' spell lists (i.e., spell lists readily learnable only by characters in that profession)
-  1 set of 'evil' spell lists for each realm of power (i.e., spell lists learnable only by evil characters)
-  1 set of 'closed' spell lists for each realm of power (i.e., spell lists somewhat difficult to learn by characters of the realm)
-  1 set of 'open' spell lists for each realm of pow -er (i.e., spell lists easily learnable by characters in any profession of the realm)

The spells contained in this book are organized into lists that reflect a coherent advancement of knowledge in specific areas of magic. Higher-level spells found on  a  given  list  will  reflect  the  increased  knowledge and efficiency that  comes from the use and practice associated  with  lower  level  spells  on  the  same  list. This  reflects  the  learning  process  that  accompanies development within a consistent spell grouping.

Each spellcasting profession has its own set of Base lists which are the product of the specific training and aptitude  characteristic  of  that  profession.  For  some professions,  the  Base  lists  are  unified  only  by  their suitability to that profession's typical role. For other professions,  Base  lists  form  a  linked  set  with  spells supporting each other across different lists and build -ing up a unified and complex array of abilities. The Open and Closed Channeling healing spell lists like -wise form such a logical set.

The spells are described in a standard manner, using a basic format that simplifies usage. Most spells are specific,  while  others  are  accorded  great  flexibility. The latter group's spells have descriptions that are less concrete, providing the Gamemaster with a framework by which to apply spell usage within the chosen world system or deal with specific occurrences that demand a certain flexibility. This may be particularly true with regard to powerful spells.

In addition to a comprehensive set of standard rules, optional rules are included to provide even greater detail.  A Gamemaster should examine each of these rules to determine if it is appropriate for the specific game and world system.
