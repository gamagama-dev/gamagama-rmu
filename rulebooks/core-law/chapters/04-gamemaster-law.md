## Part III: Gamemaster Law

Character  Law provides  the  roles  to  be played  as  well  as  the  skills  and  the  ma -neuvers to use them in. Arms Law offers the characters the challenge of battle, with its  risks  and  dangers.  Here, Gamemaster Law provides the remaining tools a game -master will need to create their stories and adventures.

Chapter 12 provides the tools for design -ing  a  campaign,  defining  the  tone  and power level of the game, and customizing the races, cultures, and professions to suit the setting. Guidelines are provided for ex -perience points, to reward players for ac -complishing tasks and advancing the story.

Chapter  13  covers  health,  healing,  and death,  including  the  treatment  of  injuries and their natural recovery.

In  Chapter 14, the psychology and inter -actions  of  non-player  characters  are  de -scribed, providing guidance in determining their  reactions.  Players  may  need  to  per -suade, inspire, or deceive them to achieve their goals, depending on whether they are allies, adversaries, or simply inhabitants of the world the Gamemaster is creating.

The final chapter describes hazards of the environment.  These  include  extremes  of temperature, drowning,  falling, poison, disease, and darkness.

Being  the  Gamemaster  of  a  roleplaying game involves a lot of separate jobs rolled up into one. The GM must direct the action, act  out  all  the  non-player  roles,  resolve disputes,  and  keep  the  flow  of  the  game moving.  Stepping  back  from  the  action, the GM also writes all the elements of the story not controlled by the players. Rolemaster can be used as the basis for many different stories, and the rules in these sec -tions will help the GM get the job done at the gaming table and customize the game to fit the style of action he wants to run.

### 12. Gamemastering

12.1. Power Level

Rolemaster is easily customizable to allow for a wide variety  of  gaming  styles  and  settings.  Some  groups may like to play low-powered games where the char -acters are ordinary, while others prefer games where their characters are epic figures in a dynamic world. Some skills, spells, or talents may not be appropriate in  one  campaign,  but  necessary  or  even  casual  ele -ments in another. To allow for a broad range of power, Rolemaster can be scaled based on the relative power of the characters to the rest of the world.

The  power  level  of  the  characters  may  range  from Average  to  Epic.  These  power  levels  are  used  as  a guideline in making decisions about what rules are to be allowed. The GM may even decide to use different power  levels  in  different  parts  of  the  rules,  such  as using a Heroic power level for generating characters but an Average power level when dealing with spell list availability ( Spell Law ) or power point recovery. These power levels are given to help GMs, not to tie them down or hamper them, so as always the GM can modify as he sees fit.

- Average - The player characters are average people. Training in skills will be the single most import -ant factor in play, rather than exceptional stats or innate talents.
- Superior - The player characters are well above average. Training in skills is still a very strong factor, but they will stand out as better than peo -ple of the same profession and level due to their individual superiority and natural talent. (This is Rolemaster 's default level).
- Heroic -  The  player  characters  are  highly  excep -tional,  in  the  top  1%  of  the  population.  While training in skills is still important, the characters are all  cream of the crop, Olympic quality level in  their  chosen  fields;  their  innate  ability  makes them  stand  out  above  the  average  compared  to other characters of the same profession and level.
- Legendary -  The  player  characters  at  this  pow -er  level  are  now  once  in  a  generation  prodigies. Training  in  skills  gets  a  giant  push  from  innate talent. They now not only stand out in the crowd, the crowd has a hard time keeping up.
- Epic -  The  player  characters  at  epic  power  levels exceed the averages by so much they no longer really  fit  into  the  same  frame. They  are  pushing into superhuman or demigod-like levels of innate ability.

The  most  obvious  effect  of  varying  Power  Level  is in  the  character's  statistics,  which  has  an  impact  on all levels. Varying the total bonuses available for pro -fessional knacks will have the biggest impact on low level characters.

Stat boosts refers to the option to replace a stat with average  values,  replace  your  highest  temporary  stat with 90, etc.,  as  described  in  Section  2.5. When  re -placing  a  stat  value  with  average  values,  see  Table 12-1 for those values. For example, at the Heroic lev -el, the average temporary stat is 61, and the average potential is 81.

For power point recovery, characters get back the list -ed percentage of their Power Development total every two hours of sleep, as indicated in Table 12-1. This will have an effect on magic-using classes at all levels by  increasing  how  many  spells  they  will  ultimately be able to cast over time. The maximum recovery per day is achieved in eight hours of sleep. Characters that need less sleep will recover more quickly but to the same maximum. For example, a character that needs 4 hours of sleep per night will recover the listed percent -age each hour of sleep but only to a limit of 4 hours.

Example: Shadow World is a high fantasy setting with potentially powerful foes and magic. The GM wants the characters to be heroes in this setting where they use powerful magic and weapons to help combat epic foes and so sets the campaign's Power Level to Legendary.

Example: A game set in Europe's Dark Ages has no magic at all, and with limited technology. The GM begins the characters as normal peasants, with no special powers and of average abilities. He sets the campaign's Power Level to Average.

#### Characters

Some  GMs  and  players  prefer  stronger  or  weaker starting  characters  for  different  styles  of  game  play. The default Superior level method (Section 2.5) will generate slightly above average characters.

Superior characters will have average temporary stats of 56 and average potential stats of 78. To use a dif -ferent power method, change the Reroll threshold. For Superior anything 10 or less is rolled again, while for Average power level there are no rerolls. The 'Average Stat' columns on table 12-1 indicate what the average stats would be for different power levels. In addition, players may replace their rolled temporary and poten -tial stats for two stats with the averages shown on the table (56 and 78 for Superior characters).

If  using  the  optional  point-buy  method,  change  the number of points used to buy stats as shown in Table 12-1.  The  default  method  presented  in  Section  3.5 gives 15 points.

Power level also determines the bonuses given as Pro -fessional Knacks. The default power level presented in Section 2.4 gives two +5 bonuses. Use Table 12-1 to determine Professional Knacks for other power levels. The notation of '+10 (+5 max)' means a total of +10 bonus, but a max of +5 to any one skill.

#### 12.2. Starting Level

Varying the starting level permits very different styles of play. Some GMs may want to run a group of inex -perienced waifs through a city adventure while other GMs want to run experienced heroes fighting power -ful foes. Level is different than Power Level. Power Level represents the character's overall power relative to his peers, while level is a gauge of experience.

Rolemaster is  primarily  a  skill-based  game,  which assumes a certain amount of training and real-life ex -perience. While age does not solely determine real-life experience, it is true that older characters tend to be more  experienced  and  thus  higher  level.  However, there  can  certainly  be  exceptionally  well-traveled teenagers and stagnant adults. Individuals who have worked their way through difficult circumstances are the most likely to have advanced in level. Those who have lived a static, familiar routine have less opportu -nity to grow and develop. Individuals driven by ambi -tion, curiosity, or a desire to improve themselves may exceed these expectations.

When deciding starting level, consider the types and difficulties of the challenges in the campaign, as well as the background of the characters that are to be part of the story. A first level character is not a veteran of many  battles,  nor  is  a  tenth  level  character  a  naïve farm boy.

The first few levels in Rolemaster are often made up of adolescents who are still apprenticed, depending on the profession. Table 12-2 has examples of names or titles based on level and an age guide, indicating level for one's approximate age. The GM may find this more useful for NPCs, keeping in mind that actual level can vary  wildly  depending  on  the  type  of  NPC  desired. These are not rules written in stone, merely guidelines from which a GM can start from before they tweak to fit their world or any specific character or NPC.

First level characters have minimal training and little experience. They may be apprentices or novices who are beginning their studies but have not yet reached any advanced level of competence. Spellcasters will have few spells, in some cases only permitting them a support role. Adventures at this level may focus on earning  their  apprenticeships  or  serve  as  a  prologue to a story that is only beginning to unfold. Challenges based on skills should allow for the possibility of fail -ure, with easier tasks or tasks which can be complet -ed gradually over multiple attempts (e.g. percentage maneuvers). Competition against their peers provides many opportunities to win and lose. Combat should be low stakes, with foes who are more interested in scaring them off, teaching them a lesson, or robbing them, rather than fights to the death. Avoid outnum -bering a first level party, as a numerical advantage can quickly become overwhelming. Foes at this level are likely to also be untrained, and may break and flee as soon as a fight turns against them. Fights with more serious consequences should be tilted in favor of the PCs, with a numerical advantage or superior position such as an unwary enemy. If you want to run a cam -paign focused on young, unusually talented prodigies up  against  more  serious  threats,  consider  increasing the  power  level,  as  higher  stats  and  knacks  will  to some extent compensate for few skill ranks, although spellcasters will still be severely limited much more than their martial companions.

Second and third level characters are reaching a ba -sic  level  of  competence.  As  adventurers  go,  they are still  beginners but have more ability to stand on their own. Spellcasters will have a reasonable but not overwhelming variety of spells, some of which will be more potent especially if they have developed lists above their level. Some of the same considerations ap -ply as for first level characters, but it's not as necessary to  go  easy  on  them,  especially  once  the  players  are familiar with their characters' abilities. They won't be the most capable people around, but might be called upon when the more experienced NPCs already have their hands full.

For  players  who  are  unfamiliar  with Rolemaster , starting at second level can provide a good balance, allowing their characters to be reasonably capable but not overwhelming the players with too many options. Their  characters  can  grow  as  their  familiarity  with the  system  advances,  giving  them  more  opportunity to  adjust  their  character  development based on their experience.

By fifth level, the characters are skilled and capable. In many cases, especially in smaller settlements, they may be the best suited to deal with problems and dan -gers, and people may turn to them for help. This is es -pecially true if they are spellcasters in settings where magic is uncommon. Whatever their professions, they can handle more serious threats and have more ability to  come  up  with  unexpected  solutions  to  problems, although there will still be situations they are better off  running  from.  Required  maneuvers  can  be  more difficult and fights can be higher stakes, although most intelligent foes regardless of level are prone to run or surrender  when  the  battle  turns  significantly  against them. If  the  characters  are  starting  at  this  level,  ask where they received their training and what experienc -es  they  have  had.  Mentors  may  provide  useful  con -tacts, advice, and story hooks.

Tenth level characters are extremely skilled veterans. They will usually be the most talented people avail -able and they will be sought out to solve problems and provide  guidance.  They  can  take  on  serious  threats and, if given the opportunity to plan and gain a strate -gic advantage while working as a team, may be able to defeat foes stronger than themselves. If the characters are  starting  at  this  level,  they  are  likely  veterans  of extended campaigns. Unless they have traveled from afar, they will already have reputations and contacts.

Twentieth  level  characters  are  legendary.  If  they are  spellcasters,  they  are  capable  of  miracles.  Their breadth  of  abilities  will  make  them  harder  to  chal -lenge, but there will be no doubt they are the people to go to when problems arise that are worth their time.

People  will  travel  great  distances  to  seek  their  help or apprentice under them, and if they have made any effort to ingratiate themselves with the local nobility they are likely to have earned titles and station. Char -acters starting at this level may be nobles, guildmas -ters, or high priests, who are forced to set aside their normal day-to-day duties to deal with unprecedented threats. They will be well known unless they are new to the area, in which case they will quickly develop a mystique and be the focus of wild rumors for good and ill.

12.3. Starting Wealth

A Gamemaster must also decide how much equipment and money characters begin with. Take into account the  overall  wealth  of  the  setting  first,  before  deter -mining the character's standing. In some settings only members of the nobility might be rich, while in some dark,  gritty  settings  everyone  is  poor.  Do  not  allow your  players  to  start  the  game  with  10  gold  each  if the royal treasury only contains 500 gold. Table 6-0b presents  starting  money  based  on  starting  level  and five wealth categories.

In addition to wealth, the GM may place restrictions on what equipment is available based on the setting as discussed in Chapter 6. Perhaps no one has invented plate armor, or civilians may not be allowed to own swords.  If  metal  is  rare  you  could  make  any  metal items cost twice as much when players choose starting equipment.

#### 12.4. Awarding Experience

Character rewards can take many forms, from treasure to earning a place in history. However, among these, Experience Points (EP) are one of the most obvious and are a significant factor in most role-playing games. Characters  gain  experience,  and  therefore  skills  and abilities, by being awarded EP by the GM at the end of each playing session.

A  character's  level  increases  every  10,000  EP.  This includes Level 1 (i.e., at the start of level 1, a charac -ter has 10,000 EP). Thus level can be determined by dividing EP by 10,000 and rounding down.

Example: Dral, after a series of adventures, has a total of 75,614 experience points, which is more than the 70,000 minimum for 7th level and fewer than the 80,000 required to be 8th level. Dral is 7th level.

The system presented here awards EP on the basis of participating in significant events. This could be per -sonal accomplishment of set goals, or completing mis -sions important to the session or overall story. Events

<!-- image -->

are broken into three types: personal events, session events, and story events. If more than one event type appears to apply in a situation, both types of EP will be awarded. This often results in a single character get -ting a personal reward on top of the session or story award that the whole party will get. This makes sure that people who do more get a bit more reward, but also ensures that those that support an action and make it possible also get a fair share. Often failure teaches us important lessons, so the GM may award experi -ence for failures that teach a lesson as well.

Example: Karlo strikes down the dread demon lord Goraili, a major personal event, but Goraili was the major opponent of this session, so killing him was also a major session event. Goraili was one of the four demon lords the party has been hunting for months, as part of their plan to eliminate the demon invasion, so killing Goraili was also a moderate story event. While each member of the party receives EP for accomplishing a major session event and a moderate story event, only Karlo gets the major personal event EP for killing the demon lord.

Slower or Faster Advancement

On average,  characters  will  go  up  a  level  every  2 or 3 sessions. This may be too slow for some GMs and too  fast  for  others.  For  slower  leveling,  figure EP using the guidelines below and cut them in half. For faster leveling double the awards, although it is recommended that more than 1 level is never gained at one time.

Some GMs may even want characters to go up the first few levels quickly and higher levels much more slowly. In this case the GM may use faster leveling for levels 1-5, normal leveling for levels 6-20, and slower leveling for levels 21+.

##### Personal Events

A personal event is any event that fulfills the personal plans or desires of the character accomplishing it (or being affected by it). If Alex is playing a Bard who seeks out folk tales, learning a new folk tale would be a personal event, whereas if he kills some Orc simply to survive, that's an achievement that is in no way per -sonal, but quite generic and relevant only as a means to achieving something else.

A  minor  personal  event  award  should  be  given  for achieving one of the character's desires without a spe -cific plan (e.g., Kyle the Dragonwatcher sees a dragon fly  directly  overhead  for  the  first  time). A  moderate personal event should be given for something where the character was specifically working to achieve that desire  when it  happened (e.g.,  Kyle  had  learned  the dragon's flight route and waited in a suitable spot). A major personal event should be given for something that has required longer-range planning and effort to achieve (e.g., Kyle has spent many months to seek out the great dragon Silverflame, researched and brought an  appropriate  gift  to  be  allowed  into  the  dragon's presence,  and  made  a  sufficiently  favorable  impres -sion to be granted an extended audience).

On the failure end, if the PC roleplays his disappoint -ment with whatever poor decision or ill luck resulted in the poor result sufficiently well, and the GM deems it worthy, the event may be a learning experience.

##### Session Events

Session  events  are  achievements  during  play  that moved the session forward. These consist of short term events of the campaign contained within the session (e.g.,  'found  the  Orc  camp',  'killed  all  the  Orcs  in the camp,' or 'rescued the prisoners from the Orcs'). These events will often be common to everyone in the group, and so every member of the party will get the full EP awarded (it is not split between them). Each session should include at least one of these events, but not more than a handful.

Any accomplishment that contributes significantly to the  success  of  the  session  is  at  least  a  minor  event. To be a moderate session event, it must be something where  failure  would  make  accomplishing  the  major event of the session far more difficult or impossible (e.g.,  defeating  the  Orc  guards  and  getting  over  the rope bridge before the Orcs can cut the bridge qual -ifies because if the bridge were cut, the party would find  it  very  difficult  or  impossible  to  complete  their mission). A major session event represents the entire point of the session (e.g., did the characters defeat the Orcs they had come to fight, or did they fail?). Because various gaming groups may run longer or shorter ses -sions, consider a 'Session' to be roughly equal to a full chapter of a book if the campaign were a novel.

For failures, if they advance the story, they may still be considered session events, but the PCs must roleplay sufficiently well that they have learned from the situa -tion and/or have tried their hardest despite odds not in their favor. Losing the town to a massive Orc horde, but putting up an epic defense before being forced to withdraw, should not be punished, despite the fact it advances the situation in a bad way.

Minor Session Event

: 100-500 EP

Moderate Session Event

: 500-1,000 EP

Major Session Event

: 1,000-5,000 EP

##### Story Events

Story events are major, long term events of the cam -paign and advance the major plot line of the campaign (e.g., 'cleared all the Orcs west of the river', 'discov -ered the Orcs are being paid to raid by the Temple of the Black Hand', or 'located the site of the Temple of the Black Hand'). These events are almost always common to everyone in the group, and so every mem -ber of the party will get the full EP reward (it is not split between them). Except in sessions where major events come to a climax, there should rarely be more than one of these types of events accomplished in a single  session.  Some sessions will not accomplish a significant story event at all.

These relate to the larger events in the campaign. Any session that results in some movement forward in the overall  campaign  can  be  considered  a  minor  story event.  To  be  a  moderate  story  event,  the  characters must have made some significant progress in the over -all campaign. Major story events are ones that drasti -cally shift the overall campaign progress. Each session may have minor impact on the overall story progress, but  climactic  sessions  may  end  with  moderate  story events accomplished. Major story events are turning points, usually the focus and result of many sessions of effort finally coming to a climax.

Sometimes the most epic events are not in your favor, and failing to stop the ritual that allows the demon lord to  physically  enter  the  world  might  bode  poorly  for future events, but if the PCs did their best, and man -aged to do as much damage as they could before being forced to flee, this should still be considered a story event for EP purposes. The story has advanced in a dark way; you must have just completed part two of a trilogy.

Development Points as Experience

Rather  than  gaining  experience  points  and  spend -ing  60  Development  Points  when  a  new  level  is achieved,  EP  may  be  forgone  completely  and  DP directly awarded. This represents characters contin -ually learning and improving rather than improving many skills all at one time and suddenly gaining a bunch of new spells or abilities.

The guidelines above are still used, except that about 150 EP is equal to 1 DP. Personal events range from 1-6  DP,  Session  events  from  1-30  DP,  and  Story events from 3-60 DP, depending on if the event is minor,  moderate,  or  major.  If  the  slower  or  faster leveling  option  is  used,  these  would  be  halved  or doubled.

The character is able to use awarded DP immediate -ly, although the player may choose to save them to spend on a more expensive skill or talent. The char -acter  must still  heed  leveling  restrictions  (e.g.,  if  a character takes 1 rank in his weapon of choice and gains DP later on he must pay the rapid development cost for a 2nd rank unless he has gone up a new lev -el).  The  character  is  considered  to  have  gone  up  a level once he has been awarded 60 DP. At this point, he may increase stats.

#### 12.5. Creating Races

Races are balanced by assigning costs (in terms of Development Points) for advantages and disadvantages they  may  have.  These  are  collectively  called  racial talents and flaws, and work the same as other talents (Chapter 4).

To create a new race, total the DP costs of the race's talents &amp; flaws then subtract from 50 to get the Bonus DP for the Race. Talents need not be limited to those presented  as  racial  talents. Any  talents  could  poten -tially be used in creating new races. For instance, all individuals of your new race may be naturally Ambi -dextrous.

Race creation is an element of worldbuilding and usually done by the GM. If a player wants to create a race, he is going to need to make sure that the GM is okay with the player adding such an element to the GM's game world.

Example: In some settings, orcs and humans may occasionally interbreed, resulting in half-orcs. They are almost as hardy as orcs, but not so dimwitted. We decide they will have a +3 Constitution stat bonus, -3 Empathy, -1 Reasoning, -2 Self-Discipline, and +2 Strength. The Superior Stat and Inferior Stat talents cost 4 DP per bonus or -4 DP per penalty, so we can add up the total stat modifiers, getting a net -1 for a cost of -4 DP . We decide half-orcs will have +5 on their Physical RRs (the Physical Resistance talent for 5 DP), half that of orcs. They also have the Fast Healer talent just like orcs (10 DP) and Nightvision (10 DP), but lack Darkvision. The total cost is -4 (Stats) + 5 (Physical Resistance) + 10 (Fast Healer) + 10 Nightvision for a total of 21 DP. Subtracting that from 50, we get 29 bonus DP for half-orc characters.

#### 12.6. Creating Cultures

The provided cultures are written very broadly to be used in any fantasy setting. Many GMs will want to create  cultures  that  are  more  specific  to  their  game worlds or may, in some cases, even allow a player to make a custom culture for his character. Keep in mind that the skill ranks from a culture are those 'anyone' in  the  culture  would  have  (i.e.,  anyone  lacking  this skill set would be regarded as the village idiot). It does not imply any special talent for the skills given (that is the job of talents), although it may seem that way to outsiders. A culture of nomads that take two ranks of Riding every level will seem 'born to the saddle.' Cultures are created with a maximum of 80 DP using costs given in the cost column of Table 2-3 (e.g., every rank of Riding costs 2 DP, even if multiple ranks are included in the culture).

Example: Building a culture with 7 ranks in 'Other Lores' costs 7 DP.

Created cultures should adhere to the following guide -lines, especially if the GM is allowing a player to cre -ate a culture. Some unique cultures may diverge from these, but that should be strictly up to the GM.

-  5-7  ranks  in  a  native  language.  If  literacy  is  com -mon, add 3-6. Bilingual cultures may double these values.
-  5 ranks in Region Lore: Own Region (5 DP).
-  1 rank in Body Development (3 DP)
-  1 rank in Movement: Running (2 DP), or appropriate Movement skill. (Swimming for mermen, Flying for bird-men, etc.)
-  1 rank in Combat Training: Unarmed (4 DP).
-  There should be no ranks in Spell Lists.
-  Skills  may  be  assigned  to  a  general  skill  such  as 'Crafting'  left  to  the  player  to  specify,  or  to  a more specific skill such as 'Woodcraft'.

Small  pocket  cultures  are  more  common  than  new races, but culture creation is still an element of world creation that  GMs may want to keep to themselves. Seek permission from the GM before creating a new culture.

##### Languages

Language  can  be  a  unifying  element  among  groups with  varying  racial  or  cultural  backgrounds.  On  the other  hand,  it  can  also  be  a  barrier  that  can  lead  to the destruction of a hearty group of adventurers. Be -cause most worlds embrace a number of tongues and few characters know all the languages, translators and cooperative  efforts  may  be  necessary  to  overcome communication  problems.  By  having  each  player's character know and/or understand (to varying degrees) different languages, a tremendous amount of diversity can be injected into the game.

To allow for games that place emphasis on languages with multi-lingual cultures, allow starting characters to take the multilingual talent (Section 4.7).

#### 12.7. Creating Professions

New professions can be easily created by using one of the existing professions as a template. Professions are created using a point system, called aptitudes. Ap -titudes  are  spent  to  raise  and  lower  the  cost  of  skill categories, and can be used to gain access to spell lists and realms.

DP costs are adjusted on a scale of fixed steps, thus increasing the DP cost of a skill category by one step

causes it to go to the next higher DP cost. The skill costs are: 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 2/4, 3/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/10, 9/12, 12/15, and 15/20. Skills cannot be lowered be -low a cost of 1/2, or raised above 15/20. The GM is advised to use the existing professions as guidelines for best and worst skill costs. No one is better at fight -ing than a fighter or better at magic than the existing pure spellcasters; conversely, no one is worse at magic than a fighter or worse at fighting than a lay healer or illusionist.

Reducing the cost of a skill category by one step costs aptitude(s), and increasing the cost of a skill category by one step gives aptitude(s) back. Most categories are 1 aptitude each except for the Spellcasting and Combat Training categories, which are 3 aptitudes each. Any change to Combat Training affects all of the Combat Training  costs,  they  are  not  adjusted  independently, and likewise for Spellcasting.

Example: Reducing the cost of Spellcasting by 1 step requires raising the cost of other categories by a total of 3 steps (e.g., one category by 3 steps, three categories by 1 step). All of the Spellcasting skills (Base, Open, Closed, Restricted, Arcane, Magical Ritual) are all reduced by 1 step.

After assigning DP costs, each profession must be as -signed 15 possible professional skills. This is the list from which characters may select professional skills and knacks.

Finally,  spellcasting  professions  have  a  realm  (or realms, if a hybrid), and 6 base spell lists; each of the existing spellcasting and hybrid professions have al -ready had the aptitude cost applied for access to these lists. Base Lists cost 2 aptitudes for every 3 base lists, and  each  additional  realm  costs  5  aptitudes.  Hybrid casters  also  receive  a  two  step  discount  on  Arcane spell lists, reflecting their better understanding of how to combine magic from multiple realms.

Custom-built professions to fit a game world are the GM's domain. If a player  wants  to  create  a  custom profession, he should seek GM clearance that such a thing is even allowed before proceeding.

#### 12.8. Skills

The skill list provided is intended to be a default list, generally applicable to most fantasy campaigns. Most Gamemasters,  or  players,  will  wish  to  add  skills  or specializations  to  help  flesh  out  the  character,  such as  specific  Lore  or  Crafting  skills.  Different  settings or genres may have unique technology or magic that will  require  adding  skills.  Whenever  possible,  it  is preferable  to  add  specializations,  which  can  benefit from existing professional skill  bonuses,  rather  than entirely new skills. Similarly, some skills may not be appropriate for all settings. In particular, the Adrenal skills (in the Body Discipline category) can allow for near superhuman athletic feats. Using them can help keep Arms  Users  on  par  with  spellcasters,  however some GMs may not want superhuman feats to be pos -sible without magic.

If the number of skills is changed drastically, such as by removing a lot of specializations and only requir -ing development in the more general skill, the number of  Development  Points  gained  each  level  should  be adjusted. There is no hard and fast rule, as it depends on  how  important  the  skills  are  that  were  added  or removed. As a starting point, consider adding or sub -tracting 1 DP for every 2 skills.

#### 12.9. Talents &amp; Flaws

Talents  and  flaws  should  be  considered  completely optional,  where  the  GM  has  final  say  if  each  talent and flaw is available or not. Talents and combinations of talents can often upset game balance, so some care should be taken when allowing them, with the default being no. Some suggestions for using talents/flaws in your game are:

-  Allow  talents,  but  only  the  bonus  DP  due  to  race may be spent on a set of initial talents at character creation. No new talents may be gained afterward, although the initial talents may be improved upon.
-  Characters  have  unrestricted  access  to  talents  at character creation but only with points gained via flaws.
-  Elves  are  particularly  magical  in  this  setting,  so Elves may take up to 30 DP in all 'Magical' tal -ents, while other talent purchases are limited to 20 DP.
-  A GM knows his group has trouble staying on track and would like to see less digression in the next campaign, so he cuts the cost of Destiny Sense in half.
-  The GM has players write up character backgrounds first,  then  decides  appropriate  talents  that  would fit those backgrounds to offer to players. They can choose among the offered talents, but are not re -quired to take any.
-  Discipline talents are restricted to only two monastic orders that teach the secrets to only full members of the order, and are apt to hunt down and punish those who break the secrecy of the order.

### 13. Health

The health, life, and death of characters, allies, and en -emies, play an important role in a campaign. Health is most often adversely affected by injuries, but it could also be affected by short term fatigue effects.

#### 13.1. Healing

In a game where combat and dangerous maneuvers are frequent, healing becomes an important part of game -play. In Rolemaster , where characters can bleed, break bones and lose limbs, healing becomes a detailed part of gameplay where specif -ic injuries require specific healing methods, be it from skills or spells.

Concussion hits are an abstract  way  of  tracking a  character's  pain,  degree of  injuries  and  hold  on consciousness.  A  charac -ter  reduced  to  0  or  fewer hits will fall unconscious. Characters at less than full hits will feel bruised, beat -en and shaken.

Even without spells, herbs or  medicine,  a  combatant may  rally  from  some  injuries,  barring  infections. Hits  are  recovered  over time,  from  rest  or  sleep. For every two continuous hours of rest or sleep, 10% of the character's total hits are recovered.

Injuries  (specific  damage to a part of the body) apply a  penalty  that  represents the pain and incapacity caused by the injury. They require longer recovery even  after  being  'healed.'

healing herbs will not provide any advantage beyond the bonus to the Medicine maneuver, but appropriate magical herbs provide additional advantages as shown on Table 13-1a and discussed below. Healing herbs are described in Treasure Law .  Healing spells are effec -tive without the need for a Medicine maneuver. These spells are described in Spell Law .

When  an  injury  is  treated,  a  d100OE  recovery  roll is  made  (Table  13-1a),  adding  the  character's  Body Development  ranks,  their  Constitution  stat  bonus,

Injuries are assigned a severity depending on the pen -alty (or amount of bleeding) as shown in Table 13-1a. The injury severity is used in spell descriptions and for healing maneuvers.

Injuries may be treated using Medicine skill, healing herbs, or spells. The use of Medicine skill is described in the sections below along with treatment options and difficulties.  Use  of  healing  herbs  requires  an  Herb -alism  maneuver  which,  if  successful,  grants  +25  on the Medicine maneuver to treat the injury. Mundane and any listed modifier for the type of  healing (medicine,  magic,  and/or herbalism),  and  subtract -ing the injury penalty for the injury to determine how  long  it  will  take  to recover.  The  result  is  the number  of  days  it  takes for  a  light  injury  penalty to  completely  fade.  Me -dium  and  severe  injuries multiply  the  days  by  x5 and x10. Some races also have a recovery multiplier other than 1 (x1/2 or x2), which  further multiplies the  recovery  time.  With proper facilities, each day of complete and utter rest is treated as two days. The modifier for Medicine Success  indicates  a  successful  Medicine  maneu -ver to treat the injury (with difficulties according to the treatment type), while Magic  indicates  the  use of a healing or relief spell appropriate  to  the  injury; the two modifiers are not cumulative. Herbalism

Success indicates a successful Medicine maneuver to treat the injury while successfully using an appropri -ate magical healing herb.

Divide the penalty by the recovery time to determine how much the penalty is reduced every day. If the re -covery time is short and the penalty moderate, it may make more sense to measure recovery by the hour. If it does not divide evenly, reduce the penalty the most on the first day(s) (so for a -15 penalty that heals in 10

days, heal -2 each day for the first five days, then -1 each day for the last five days).

Example: Garath is recovering from a fractured arm (-30). Yorell, unfortunately out of herbs, manages to set the bone and put it in a sling. Yorell' s Medicine roll results in an Absolute Success, giving Garath a +25 to his Recovery Roll. Garath rolls an 84 for recovery + 10 Body Development ranks + 6 Constitution bonus - 30 for the injury + 25 for an Absolute Success on the Medicine roll for a total of 95. This results in a four-day recovery, however it is a Medium injury so it is x5 the rolled recovery (20 days). -30/20 days is -1/day, with -10 left over. Thus, Garath's penalty reduces by -2 per day for the first 10 days, then -1 per day after that until fully recovered. Also, every full, complete day of rest is treated as two for purposes of recovery, so Garath decides to hibernate for a while.

If the injury is not healed, but the character rests and keeps the area immobile, a recovery roll can be made at  -100  and  also  treated  as  an  automatic  permanent injury (see below). A broken arm will heal poorly on its own, albeit slowly, and may never be as good as it once was. The character must rest and keep the area immobile or else recovery will halt. For some injuries the GM may rule that they cannot get better at all with -out being healed, or will even get worse.

For some injuries, treatment may require the patient to  rest  or  move  no  faster  than  a  walk.  If  the  patient does  engage  in  more  strenuous  activity  (requiring  a maneuver  roll),  a  Failure  on  the  maneuver  roll  will mean the wound will need to be treated again (and re -covery rerolled). An Absolute Failure will also double the remaining penalty.

These rules should make it pretty clear that in games without  magical  healing,  the  GM  should  schedule significant  downtime  between  combat  sessions,  or be ready to deal with the crippled PCs dealing with conflict while limping and favoring one side. Some -times a combat encounter you'd laugh at when healthy becomes challenging and fun when badly hurt. A 10th level  fighter  might  laugh  when  confronted by a few giant rats, but after falling down a well and breaking his leg, it's suddenly not so funny.

##### Permanent Injuries

It is possible for injuries to cause long-lasting effects. Light injuries will never develop permanent injuries (unless they are not treated). For Medium and Severe injuries,  the  Recovery  roll  is  used  to  determine  if  a permanent injury develops. If the roll is even doubles (22,  44,  66,  88,  100)  for  a  Medium  injury,  or  any doubles for a Severe injury, then there is a chance of a permanent injury. Make a second Recovery roll as normal and consult Table 13-1b, using all modifiers from  Table  13-1a,  but  also  subtracting  the  penalty from the injury.

A permanent injury is nerve damage which is very dif -ficult to treat, and traditional medicine can do little for it. Magical healing through spells or herbs for healing nerve  damage,  or  possibly  advanced  medicine  (GM discretion) may be used, in which case use the organ column on the recovery table to determine recovery time after healing.

##### Organ Injuries

Organ injuries are extremely difficult to treat and very slow to heal. Destroyed organs may have permanent effects  (e.g.,  loss  of  vision),  if  not  causing  outright death.

-  The external wound can be dressed (Very Hard, -20) in the case of Light wounds, allowing healing to proceed (treatment takes 2-5 minutes).
-  Surgery (Absurd, -70) is required with Medium or Severe wounds (1-4 hours).

##### Bleeding Injuries

If bleeding injuries are accompanied by a penalty, then the  penalty  itself  is  due  to  the  cut  or  wound  and  is healed and recovered as a 'Cut'. Medical skills can be used to stabilize or slow bleeding using several differ -ent methods.

-  Direct pressure (Easy, +20) can be used to stop the bleeding of minor wounds or slow the bleeding of more serious wounds (by 4 hits/round). Loss of hits will stop immediately once treatment begins, but  another  minute  of  treatment  is  required  per point of bleeding or the wound will immediately reopen. After treatment, any action more rigorous than walking will reopen the wound.

<!-- image -->

-  Stitches (Medium, +0) can be used on Light or Me -dium  wounds  to  prevent  reopening  of  wounds, and they will also lower the penalty. Stitches take 3 minutes per point of bleeding. Halve the penal -ties for any successfully stitched open wound. A failure  for  any  violent  motion  (attacking,  move -ment  or  a  maneuver  requiring  a  maneuver  roll) will reopen the wound.
-  Tourniquets  (Very  Hard,  -20)  can  be  used  to  stop severe bleeding wounds on limbs other than the head (taking just 2 rounds), but they must be loos -ened and allowed to bleed for 1 round after every 10 rounds held tight or the limb will die.
-  A wound can be cauterized (Routine, +30, increas -ing -5 per point of bleeding), given a torch or hot metal object. The patient will often take damage from the heat, although most find this preferable to bleeding to death. The results of cauterization are given in Table 13-1c. If a resulting Heat crit -ical  roll  specifies  an  area  other  than  the  injured area, find the next lower result affecting the cor -rect area. Cauterization itself can be performed in a round, if a suitable source of heat is available, but building a fire hot enough to sufficiently heat a steel tool could take much longer.

##### Bone Injuries

Generally speaking, a Light bone injury is a simple fracture, a Medium injury is a compound fracture, and Severe injury is a shattered bone. Medical skills are best used to set and splint the injured limb. Injuries to joints (knees, ankles, elbows, etc.) that include broken or shattered bone will also have cartilage damage and require both bone and cartilage repair to heal.

-  A splint (Easy, +20) can be crudely made from mate -rials at hand, and takes 2-5 minutes to apply once a splint is available. For a leg, the patient cannot move faster than a walk, and for arms the limb is unusable while in the splint, but the limb is kept stable.
-  A  brace  or  plaster  cast  (Medium, +0) is more per -manent. For a leg, the patient can move no faster than Creep (x0.5), or Walk (x1) with a cane, or Jog (x2), with crutches. For all limbs, the penalties are effectively halved for maneuvers (but use the full penalty  when  determining  the  daily  lowering  of the penalty through healing). Creating a brace to fit the patient is a Medium crafting maneuver in an appropriate craft.
-  Surgery  (Sheer  Folly,  -50)  can  be  used  on  Severe injuries  and  is  generally  the  only  option  other than magic (surgery requires 1d4 hours). A cast or brace is needed afterwards.

##### Burn Injuries

Burn Injuries have a high chance of infection, giving -20 to RR vs infection (Section 15.6) and can take much longer to heal if not treated.

-  Applying  cool  water  and  bandages  (Easy,  +20)  is effective on Light and Medium wounds (1st and 2nd degree burns) and prevents the possibility of blisters becoming infected (2-5 minutes).
-  A salve (Light, +10) can also be used (3-6 minutes including bandaging). This will give a further bo -nus (or penalty!) to the healing roll based on the qualities  of  the  herbs  or  medicines  in  the  salve. The wound is then dressed with bandages (includ -ed in this maneuver roll).
-  Surgery  (Extremely  Hard,  -30)  can  be  used  to  re -move the burnt flesh and debris and properly dress the wound in the case of Severe wounds (one hour or more). If burns encircle a limb, surgery may be required to prevent loss of the limb due to com -partment syndrome, 8-24 hours after the injury is sustained.

It was a noble attempt. You may have actually prevented more damage than you just caused.  Bleeding is halved but patient takes a C Heat critical + 3d10 hits.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Hilarity  ensues…depending  on  your  viewpoint.  The  cauter -ization  attempt  is  accompanied  by  mixed  emotions  from  all involved, yet elicits giggles or guffaws from most.  The patient ends up on fire, with actual results based on the final roll (Suc -cess or Failure).

76 - 100 Partial Success

Not a bad job really, you quite possibly saved a life.  But was the cure worse? The bleeding stops but the patient takes a  B Heat critical + 2d10 hits.

101 - 175 Success

Not bad. You expertly apply the flame and stop the bleeding with only a small amount of screaming. Patient takes an A Heat critical + 1d10 hits.

176 + Absolute Success

From this point on you shall be referred to as the Flamemaster. The bleeding is stopped with no other damage.  You are advised to not try this again so you can keep your reputation, and the Flamemaster name.

##### Muscle, Tendon, Cartilage &amp; Ligament Injuries

Generally speaking, a Light injury is a sprain or strain, a Medium injury is a tear or dislocation, and a Severe injury is a severed tendon, ligament, or muscle. These tend to be common injuries, and require rest in order to heal.

-  Splints and braces can be used as with bone injuries in  order  to  keep  the  injured  area  immobile  until healed (2-5 minutes).
-  Surgery (Sheer Folly, -50) can be used to close the injury and bind it or to reconnect severed tendons, ligaments, or muscles (1-4 hours). This is required on Severe wounds, but can be used on less severe wounds.

##### Skin &amp; Tissue Injuries

This is the most common type of injury and is consid -ered a flesh wound. Any wound not given a specific injury from the above descriptions (bleed, bone, burn, muscle/tendon, organ), is a Skin &amp; Tissue injury. They heal relatively quickly, treatment is easy to perform, and the chance of infection is low.

-  The injury can be dressed (Routine, +30) in the case of Light, Medium, and Severe injuries (2-5 min -utes).

Example: After a serious battle, Karn has a serious cut in his arm that is bleeding at 4 hits/round and a torn muscle in his other arm that is at -30. Luckily, his companion Mordryn is skilled at Medicine. Stopping the bleeding requires a Medicine maneuver at +20 for direct pressure, while the muscle requires rest, although a splint or brace would help in order to keep the arm immobile.

##### Amputation

In some cases of severe injury, disease, infection, or poison it may be necessary to amputate a limb. Given time (1-4 hours) and suitable supplies, the limb can be removed surgically (Sheer Folly, -50). In an emer -gency, a tourniquet can be used when chopping off the limb, followed by cauterization to stop the bleeding (Extremely Hard, -30). For recovery, treat as separate -40 bone, muscle, and skin injuries, plus burn injuries if cauterization was used. In either case, Failure results in additional harm (roll as a D Slash critical, using the next lower result for the affected area), and Absolute Failure  results  in  system  shock  and  death  in  2d10 rounds (see Shock and System Shock, below).

Non-surgical amputation will always result in permanent injuries (in addition to the loss of the limb itself) unless an absolute success is rolled on Table 13-1b.

<!-- image -->

##### Head Injuries

Head  injuries  can  complicate  all  of  the  above. Any Medical maneuver on head injuries is increased one difficulty, and these wounds take longer to heal. Use the appropriate healing recovery table for the type of injury (typically Bleed, Bone, Burn, and Skin &amp; Tis -sue injuries), but double the time needed to heal.

##### Shock and System Shock

Simple shock is a leading cause of death from trau -ma and is as simple as the body using up all its blood sugar. The treatment is to have the patient ingest some sugar  and  to  warm  the  patient  to  relieve  the  caloric need for self-heating. None of the critical results cause this, but 'the shakes', nausea and fainting spells just after  combat are fairly common, and the GM or the PCs can feel free to use any of these for roleplaying color. It is a simple Medicine maneuver to treat this form of shock; without help, the character will be at a -25 to fatigue checks for 1 hour.

The more dangerous system shock referred to in many criticals, which will cause death in a specified number of rounds, is this exact form of body running out of resources, compounded with a massive injury that is expending resources faster than the body can restore them.  Most  of  these  results  will  end  up  being  fatal without magic at the low tech level of fantasy, but it is possible for two non-magical healers working togeth -er to deal with this problem.

While one healer makes a medium First Aid maneuver each round to delay death by one round (2 rounds with absolute success), using sugar (usually in some liquid form), heat, respiratory assistance and/or chest com -pressions, the other healer attempts to fix the under -

lying injury which is causing the system shock. The first healer must keep making maneuvers to keep the patient alive until the second healer successfully treats the underlying injury (see the appropriate section of the rules above), at which point one more success will alleviate the shock problem.

#### 13.2. Life &amp; Death

A character can die if he takes enough damage to reach negative hits greater than his Body Development skill bonus (e.g., a character with +67 Body Development will die when he reaches -68 hits). In addition to death from  hits,  some  injuries  may  cause  instant  death  or death within a given time period. These injuries can only  be  healed  with  very  advanced  medicine  (see Shock and System Shock in the preceding section) or powerful magic.

What happens after death is dependent on the setting (genre and specific world). Beings in one world may have a soul that may be retrieved even after death (res -urrection) while in other settings the soul may be un -known, or not recoverable. If the game setting allows for resurrection, assume the soul departs five minutes after  bodily  death  unless  otherwise  specified  for  the world. Before the soul departs, Lifekeeping herbs or spells can be used to prevent its departure, although if the body cannot sustain life due to injuries, this will do little good in the long run. After the soul departs, only a Lifegiving spell or herb will bring the soul back to the body.

Soul  departure  and  medical  death  are  two  different things. It may be possible to be alive, but without a soul (e.g., if subject to an Absolution spell), in which case the being is in a coma… alive but unable to func -tion. In some settings, a functioning body with no soul in residence is an invitation to possession by non-cor -poreal entities like undead or demons.

If  a  character  has  died,  the  body  can  still  be  healed before the soul has left the body. However, even if the body has been healed this does not automatically make the character start breathing again or restart the heart.

##### Cardiac and Respiratory Arrest

Cardiac arrest  occurs  when  an  illness,  drug,  poison, or harmful spell causes the heart to stop functioning correctly, so that it no longer pumps blood adequately throughout  the  body.  The  person  becomes  uncon -scious, and usually stops breathing as well (respirato -ry arrest, see below). Shortly after cardiac arrest, the heart stops, a condition that is known as 'asystole,' or flat lined. The heart is not beating, and there is no electrical  activity.  This  condition  is  what  a  modern medical  practitioner  might  use  to  certify  clinical  or legal death.

Respiratory arrest is when a person stops breathing. Also called prolonged apnea, it can be caused by air -way obstruction (choking), drugs, illness, or injury. It can also occur as a result of cardiac arrest. Drowning is considered a form of airway obstruction. Vital or -gans can be damaged within 5 minutes if respiratory arrest  is  not  treated. After  exceeding  their  ability  to hold  their  breath  (see  Section  15.2  Drowning),  the character takes 1d10 hits per round and must make an Endurance check each round.

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

You reflect on the decisions that brought you here. They weren't good. There is no effect on the patient's heart but he takes a D Electricity critical + 4d10 hits.

1 - 75 Failure

You weren't completely sure this was going to work, so it's no real surprise that it doesn't. Patient takes a C Electricity critical + 3d10 hits.

UM 66

Unusual Event

The electricity  coursing  through  the  patient  has  a  deleterious effect. The patient babbles incoherently as he has a near-death experience either before he dies (failed maneuver), or before he lives  again  (successful  maneuver)! Hopefully he'll live to tell the tale.

76 - 100 Partial Success

A bit messy and certainly not harmless, but effective. Patient's heart restarts, but he takes a B Electricity critical + 2d10 hits.

101 - 175 Success

Far better than you expected, and certainly the best one could hope for. Patient's heart restarts, but he takes an A Electricity critical + 1d10 hits.

176 + Absolute Success

Bards will sing songs of this far and wide. You will be famous and live long in folks' hearts. Unless, of course, your patient is  a  nobody,  in  which  case  no  one  will  sing  and  no  one  will remember. No one cares.

Brain death, usually caused by damage to, destruction or removal of the head, causes the body to immedi -ately slip into both cardiac and respiratory arrest, and cannot be corrected without restoring or repairing the brain injury first.

##### Reviving a Body

The GM must decide if any of the below techniques are known in the game world, and specifically if the characters have sufficient medical knowledge to em -ploy them. In many early technological periods, the only thing they knew to do with a freshly dead body was to prepare for a funeral. These methods will be known  only  in  settings  with  extremely  advanced medical knowledge, equivalent to at least early 20th century understanding.

CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is used on a person whose heart has stopped, and sometimes during cardiac arrest. Depending on the emergency medicine protocols of a given area, sometimes a technique of only rapid chest compressions is used, which employs 100  chest  compressions  per  minute.  Defibrillation (electrical shocks to the heart) is used during cardiac arrest, and occasionally when the heart appears to have stopped,  but  might  still  be  functioning  with  activity that  is  just  not  detectable.  Defibrillation,  in  simple terms, shocks the heart back into functioning normally until further medical treatment can be administered.

As a rule of thumb, a person can be revived within 3-5 minutes after death (longer if the body is chilled, such as after drowning in cold water), although this assumes that there are no other complicating factors such as fatal injuries. If the character has undergone respiratory arrest, a Sheer Folly (-50) Medicine ma -neuver is required to revive him. If the character has undergone cardiac arrest (with or without respiratory arrest), then a Nigh Impossible (-100) Medicine ma -neuver is required.

In the event of a stopped heart (asystole), defibrilla -tion  (electrical  shock)  can  be  administered  given  an appropriate source of electricity. This should only be allowed if the knowledge exists that this could work! This  is  a  Medicine  maneuver  with  a  difficulty  level based  on  the  quality  of  the  equipment  or  electrical source,  ranging  between Very  Hard  (-20)  to Absurd (-70). In a fantasy setting, a spellcaster may be able to  use  a  spell  (e.g.,  Shock  Bolt,  Lightning  Bolt)  to perform  defibrillation  with  a  Very  Hard  (-20)  Spell Mastery roll (in addition to the Medicine Maneuver!).

<!-- image -->

If  the  GM  deems  the  electrical  source  is  potentially dangerous  (always  the  case  if  an  elemental  spell  is used),  then  apply  the  results  on  Table  13-2a.  If  the source  is  not  overtly  dangerous  (e.g.,  an  advanced modern defibrillator), then failure only means it has not succeeded.

##### Decomposition

Once  a  being  has  died  (or  a  limb  is  severed),  it  is subject to decomposition. The rate at which a body or body part decomposes is highly variable, depending largely on the environmental conditions. In a fantasy setting that has access to Lifegiving magic, it becomes important to know what effects decomposition has on the body, if the body is brought back to life or a limb is reattached.

The GM should determine how far advanced the de -composition is using the stages given on Table 13-2b, and if the person is successfully brought back to life, then apply the effects shown. (Keeping a body near freezing  will  slow  effects,  at  least  doubling  decom -position times.) Treat the penalty as three additional injuries  (muscle/tendon,  organ,  skin/tissue)  to  each affected  body  part  (all  7  in  the  case  of  death:  head, chest, left &amp; right arms, abdomen, left &amp; right legs). All these injuries have a penalty based on the decom -position  stage  and  must  be  healed  (and  recovered from) on top of the original injuries.

| Table 13-2b: Decomposition   | Table 13-2b: Decomposition   | Table 13-2b: Decomposition   |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Time after death             | Stage                        | Effect                       |
| 0 - 3 days                   | Fresh                        | -10                          |
| 4 - 10 days                  | Bloat                        | -25                          |
| 11 - 20 days                 | Decay                        | -50                          |
| 21 - 50 days                 | Advanced                     | -75                          |
| 51+ days                     | Dry remains                  | -100                         |

### 14. Psychology

Beyond their interactions with the environment, char -acters will encounter social beings controlled by the GM:  Non-Player  Characters  (NPCs).  NPCs  can  be other  people,  monsters  or  animals. These  rules  give the  GM tools needed for resolving interactions with NPCs.

14.1. Initial Reaction

When the PCs encounter a being for the first time, of -ten the initial attitude of the NPC has already been set by the GM for story reasons, especially if the NPC is a significant one the GM has put some thought into. Sometimes, however, the GM may want to introduce some  randomness  to  initial  reactions,  especially  for random encounters.

The GM should assess the circumstances of the en -counter from the perspective of the NPC, and apply a  modifier  from  ±100  to  the  situation.  Generally the  modification  should  be  ±10  and  rarely  be  larger than ±30, but extreme cases can apply. (A merchant who has not seen a customer come into his shop in a week might be strongly biased to be extraordinarily happy to  see  well-dressed  customers  walk  in,  while the same merchant walking alone in the middle of the night might be strongly biased to be very unhappy to encounter a group of poorly-dressed, armed men cov -ered in fresh blood on a dark street.) If the character has  made  an  effort  to  make  a  good  first  impression (e.g., dressing and presenting himself appropriately), add the number of ranks the character has in their ap -plicable Social skill.

Once the  modifier  is  established,  roll  1d100OE  and consult  Table  14-1.  The  results  in  italics  should  be used in lawless environments (on the road, out in the wilderness, in a violent dive bar, etc.).

This mechanism is just for initial reactions with strang -ers,  once  an  encounter gets past the initial reactions without one side or the other departing or attacking, use role-play and/or social skill maneuvers.

In  most  situations,  NPCs  that  know  the  person  they are encountering will respond normally based on their history  without  a  reaction  roll,  though  the  GM  may wish to make a roll to establish the NPCs' mood at the moment of the encounter. Perhaps they have been hav -ing a very good or bad day. (If someone is in disguise or for any other reason looks like someone other than himself, a fresh initial reaction roll would be appro -priate).

Table 14-1: Reactions

Roll

Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Reaction hostile (-30)

NPC immediately dislikes character and will leave or ask/force character to leave. Make a morale check for the NPC, who will attack (success) or withdraw (failure).

1 - 75 Failure

wary (-10)

NPC will interact with the character, but with a noticeable re -serve. NPC will keep an eye on the character and be ready for combat.

UM 66 Unusual Event

NPC mistakes the character for someone completely different that he dislikes (hostile or wary result) or someone he likes (re -ceptive  or  friendly  result). A  neutral  result  means  a  mistaken identification without a positive or negative opinion associated with it.

76 - 100 Partial Success

neutral (0)

NPC has no significant initial reaction to the character, and will interact without modifiers. NPC will be alert for trouble, but will interact normally.

101 - 175 Success

receptive (+10)

NPC likes the character's initial approach and will be open to interaction. NPC will relax, but will not completely let his guard down.

176 + Absolute Success friendly (+30)

NPC is happy to see the character, and will go out of his way to engage with him. NPC will relax as much as is reasonable in the situation, and will initiate interaction if the character does not do so first.

#### 14.2. Social Skills

Once you have gotten past the initial reaction, inter -acting with NPCs to get what you want involves the use  of  social  skills.  When  interacting  with  non-sen -tient NPCs, substitute an appropriate animal handling or riding skill as needed.

inflUence

I nfluence  skills  provide  a  bonus  to  maneuvers  that attempt  to  shift  people's  opinions  in  a  direction  the character desires. The GM determines how much of a shift  in  opinion  the  attempt  is  and  sets  a  difficulty.  If the maneuver is successful, the character convinces the target to change his opinion. The context of the attempt will  determine  the  difficulty  of  the  maneuver  (e.g.,  it is far easier to influence the Captain of the Guard at a cocktail party than just after he has found a rebel hiding under the hay in your cart). Failure might cause trouble, but absolute failure should result in a very negative or even hostile response. A wary target will get a S ocial Awareness maneuver to resist an Influence attempt (see Conflicting Skills, Chapter 3).

All Influence skill use can be complicated by communi -cation problems due to language or cultural differences. A character must have some form of effective commu -nication to attempt to influence a target, but partial com -munication can help or hinder (e.g., it might be harder to haggle over the price of a load of mixed goods if you only have 3 ranks in the target merchant's language, but it might be easier to get away with a simple lie if you only have 3 ranks in the target guard's language and use that confusion to bury the lie). Region Lore may make all these tasks easier; for instance knowing that metal is scarce and prized in Port Royale will let you know to set your Trading cost high, and knowing that the Emir of  Port  Royale's  guards  are  all  blood  related  to  him, and face execution if caught taking bribes, will let you know to tread carefully and set your price high in trying to  bribe  one.  Lacking  Region  Lore  can  hamper  you: you might sell the metal too cheaply or be too casual in approaching that guard with a paltry bribe.

The nature of the maneuver will determine if it is an Absolute  or  Percentage  Maneuver.  Trying  to  bribe  a guard  at  the  gate  to  let  you  in  after  dark  might  be  a Trading Absolute Maneuver, while convincing a mer -chant to take part in a complicated transaction might be a Trading Percentage Maneuver.

Charm : This skill involves knowing how to approach and interact with people so that they like you more and are willing to do you 'favors.' The more time and effort that you put into laying ground for a charm maneuver, the more effectively it works. The GM should set the difficulty based on how much time and effort the char -acter is putting into the maneuver and what 'favor' the character is asking for. Abruptly encountering someone and  immediately  requesting  a  huge  favor  is  at  least Sheer  Folly  if  not  Nigh  Impossible;  spending  a  few hours  befriending  someone  and  asking  a  small  favor might  be  Routine.  This  skill  should  be  harder  to  use than Trading, but it is getting something for nothing, the moment you move over into 'I'll do you a favor, if you do me a favor' you are using Trading and not Charm.

Duping :  This  skill  covers  knowing  how  to  lie,  bluff, or  spin  the  truth  convincingly. This  skill  can  be  used to slide a lie past someone, the difficulty being based on how plausible the lie seems to the target. Trying to convince someone of something elaborate with a lot of false details should be Absurd or harder, while a tight, small  lie  that  fits  into  what  the  target  already  knows might be Light or easier.

Intimidation : This skill covers being able to get what you want out of people by subtle or overt threat, with -out taking it so far as to make them flee for help or fight back (and without provoking a fear or morale reaction). Resolve  as  an Absolute  Maneuver  when  used  to  get immediate compliance with a direct command. When a  character  has  some  means  to  corner  and  harass  the target without interruption, then resolve as a Percent -age Maneuver. The GM should set the difficulty based on how large a threat the character levels at the target, how believable that threat is, and the apparent balance of  combat  power  between  the  two  characters  (as  the target understands it). This skill should be easier to use than  Trading,  but  the  consequences  of  failure  should be much larger. When an attempt fails on a target, he will always become hostile unless he has reason to be physically afraid of the character using intimidation, in which case he will lie and placate until he can get away, arm himself, and/or get help. Absolute failure will have the  same  effect  as  failure,  but  also  make  a  long-term enemy of the target, who will remember this moment, and do whatever he can to safely get back at the intim -idating character.

This  skill  works  as  an  influence  skill  as  long  as  it  is restrained to threats, not actual injury; when a character pushes over that line, stop using the Influence skill rules and  begin  using  the  fear/morale  rules  (Section  14.3) basing the level of attack on ranks in intimidation. Use the 'surrender' results on the table as the target capit -ulating to the demands. Per the morale rules, except in exceptional circumstances, the GM may allow PCs to just determine their responses to this sort of thing.

Violent coercion (or torture) is notoriously effective for making the victim lie and say whatever he believes the tormenter wants to hear, which makes it a favorite of in -quisitions and secret police, but it is consequently a poor way to get the truth about abstract topics that can easily be lied about and are hard or impossible to confirm, and the GM should offer any bonus he feels is reasonable, but on success, offer misleading or false information. However, when trying to coerce an action or informa -tion that is easily confirmed, such as the location of a hidden key that is in the room or the combination of a safe you are standing in front of, threats compounded with a little roughing up can offer a bonus, without the risks of a false or misleading confession just to make the pain stop.

Targets 'roughed up' in this manner will almost always resent it, and complain to the authorities or take revenge in some manner if the opportunity presents itself. Re -venge doesn't need to take the form of direct violent re -sponse; it can take the form of damaging the character's reputation, goods, associates, informing the authorities or  seeking  to  stir  up  trouble  for  their  tormenter  indi -rectly.

##### Leadership

Leadership  is  used  to  inspire  those  loyal  to  you  to follow  your  instructions  or  to  effectively  organize  a group. This skill cannot be used on those not already loyal to you, but for those who view you as their lead -er, this skill can be used to rally or inspire them.

When using this skill to try and inspire or motivate followers  outside  of  a  combat  situation,  the  GM should make a morale check per section 14.3 to see the result. (The GM should take into account how often a leader gives speeches and context; excessive constant speeches or speeches given at inappropriate moments should cause negative modifiers to these rolls as the followers begin to get annoyed, although on a success -ful  Leadership  maneuver,  the  leader  should  at  least realize this is happening.) To use Leadership in terms of  fear  and  morale  in  combat  situations,  see  section 14.3 below.

social awaReness

This skill develops awareness of the motives and so -cial  maneuvers  of  those  around  you. You  can  make maneuvers using this skill to study other people and try  to  understand  them,  determine  if  they  are  lying, or otherwise infer their motives. If someone is using this skill (i.e., not relaxed with his guard down) when targeted with an Influence skill maneuver (see above) then he can make a conflicting maneuver (Chapter 3) to notice the Influence attempt and choose to ignore the result.

tRading

Trading is used to negotiate, haggle, and strike bar -gains.  Characters  who  are  good  at  this  skill  will  be able to figure out a deal that works for both parties, if a deal is possible. In some cases this may be resolved as an opposed Absolute Maneuver. For haggling, resolve as an opposed Percentage Maneuver, where the buyer is  the  active  participant  and  the  seller  is  the  passive participant. The final price is 200% minus the result, giving a price from 50% to 200%.

The difficulty is based on how the deal the player is of -fering would look to the target. If the deal seems safe and very favorable for the target it should be easy to convince him, while if the deal seems to shortchange the  target  or  put  him  in  trouble  or  danger  it  will  be more difficult, or perhaps impossible.

Long term use of this skill on the same target should be kept in context by the GM. If a target is influenced into offering the player great prices all the time, but losing money as a result, this should start to increase the difficulty of dealing with the same person the next time  ('I'm  not  falling  for  your  tricks  this  time  you sharp trader!').

A  character  is  not  required  to  take  the  limit  of  the result,  and  can  choose  to  take  less  to  minimize  this effect and generate goodwill (e.g., a result of 200% is rolled, the character chooses to take 150% in order to not strip the target merchant too badly and maintain a positive long term relationship with this contact).

#### 14.3. Fear &amp; Morale

Most fights in the real world do not end with one side or the other killed to the last man; flight or surrender occur when the morale (fighting spirit) of one side is broken. Beyond the real world issue of morale, this is a fantasy game, and sometimes adventurers encounter supernatural terrors which prompt fear checks by their very presence.

The  GM  should  have  PCs  make  Resistance  Rolls versus fear when confronted with supernatural terrors ( Creature Law ) or terrifying situations. Spells which cause  fear  normally  require  the  usual  RR  for  their realm, but a RR against fear may be appropriate, for example, vs. something like a convincingly frighten -ing illusion.

A fear RR uses the character's fear RR bonus (unless the fear effect is directly caused by a spell, in which case use the appropriate realm bonus unless the spell description gives a specific exception) and other mod -ifiers such as a Leadership bonus. Success means no effect, while the amount the RR is failed by will de -termine the severity of any result. Injury and fatigue penalties do not normally apply to fear RRs. The effect of the fear is based on the severity as indicated on Ta -ble 14-3a.

If a character is under the command of a leader who is present, that character gets a bonus to fear RRs. In order to get a bonus, the character must actually ac -knowledge the leader (generally listen to the leader's instructions, look to the leader for guidance in stress -ful situations, etc.) and must be aware of the leader's presence (i.e., be able to see, hear, or otherwise know the leader is present and active). This bonus is equal to the leader's ranks of Leadership skill.

Supernatural  fear  effects  always  have  a  level  given, but  depending on the setting and campaign the GM may wish to use fear checks for new frightening situ -ations or for NPCs. Use the guidelines in Table 14-3a to determine the level of the fear.

Table 14-3a: Fright Level

Level Description

- 1 You are confronted with immediate danger.
- 3 An armed opponent is actively trying to harm you.
- 5 The fight is going badly, you are outnumbered, half of your allies are down or fled, or group is the target of a lethal ambush.
- 10 You are outnumbered and becoming surrounded, a superior enemy force is beginning to overrun your position, or more than half your allies are down or fled.
- 15 You face a dangerous foe you cannot harm, or more than three quarters of your allies are down or fled.
- 20 You are confronted with an unstoppable threat, or more than 90% of your allies are down or fled.
- +3 The threat includes powerful or unfamiliar supernatural or magical elements.
- +5 The threat includes powerful and unfamiliar supernatural or magical elements.

Result

Mild (fail by 1-25)

Balk: +0 to Rally

Character will not advance or pursue the enemy, but will fight if the enemy comes to him. Outside of a combat situation, the character will remove themself from the situation as quickly as they are able, possibly making excuses for a hasty departure.

Moderate (fail by 26-50) Retreat: -20 to Rally

Character will try to escape the situation, but in a controlled manner, not turning his back on the danger. If the character cannot flee, and the penalty for surrender is mild, he will surrender.

Severe (fail by 51-100)

Routed: -50 to Rally

Character will flee using at least running pace until collapsing from fatigue or reaching a place of safety where the character can no longer perceive the source of fear. Routed combatants will attack anyone who attempts to physically block retreat. If they cannot flee, they will surrender unless they are certain surrender will result in death.

Extreme (fail by 101+)

Broken: -100 to Rally

Character will flee at top speed until collapsing from fatigue. Such characters will drop weapons and gear if it allows them to flee faster. They will ignore attempts to physically stop them if at all possible. Broken combatants who cannot flee will surrender regardless of possible consequences. (The characters will drop their weapons and fall to the floor in abject terror.)

moRale

Players  almost  always  want  to  decide  when  their characters agree to do something or refuse, but it is sometimes necessary to determine if an NPC follower will agree to a command. A Morale roll is resolved by making an Absolute Maneuver, with the commander's Leadership skill bonus, plus the follower's RR bonus vs. Fear (it is easier to lead disciplined troops). The difficulty  of  the  maneuver  should  be  based  on  how reasonable or unreasonable the command appears to the NPC. If making a single roll for multiple follow -ers, just use the average RR bonus for the whole group of followers.

The results of the roll are shown on Table 14-3b. If refusal is not an option (e.g., the NPC is complying under threat of death) then the NPC will obey even on a Failure; however, it will be in a sullen, perfunctory, foot-dragging  manner.  On  an  Absolute  Failure,  the NPC may start actively sabotaging the purpose of the orders.

Table 14-3b: Morale

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Your follower sullenly refuses or even reacts with hostility. You offended him somehow and get -10 to Morale until you figure out what it is.

1 - 75 Failure

Follower  refuses.  You're  not  sure  if  he  is  being  purposefully difficult or even why. Sometimes you are just better off doing things yourself.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Somehow,  your  follower  completely  misunderstands  what  is being  asked  and  doesn't  ask  for  clarification,  so  instead  does something completely different. However, this either works out (Success or higher) in a weird way, or doesn't (Failure or less).

76 - 100 Partial Success

There is some confusion on what is desired and your follower requires further explanation. Where do you get these guys, di -al-a-minion?

101 - 175

Success

You expertly convey your desires to your follower who follows them to the best of his ability. Hopefully he actually has some ability.

176 + Absolute Success

You are destined for an executive position. Follower not only does as is ordered, but is inspired by his new hero and role-mod -el.  Follower's  fan-boy  status  grants  +5  to  Morale  rolls  for  1 month.

##### Rallying

Leaders  can  also  attempt  to  rally  someone  who  has failed a fear check, which may help them to overcome the fear. They must be able to see and hear the leader. Consult Table 14-3a to determine the modifier to the roll based on current state and Table 14-3c to resolve. If  attempting to rally multiple followers at the same time, the modifier is set to the worst affected follower in the target group, and increased by -10 for every 10 followers (round up).

moUnts and pets

Characters' mounts or pets are also susceptible to fear or morale effects and must make their own RRs. If a combatant is directing a mount or pet into a situation that  might  frighten  it,  make  a  morale  check  for  the mount, using the rider's Riding or Animal Handling skill in place of the Leadership skill. If a morale check is failed, the rider must wait one round to attempt to regain control of the mount again.

Table 14-3c: Rally

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

You manage to say all the wrong things, at the wrong times, which only ends up scaring your followers even more. Increase fear by 1 severity.

1 - 75 Failure

You are quite ineffective at rallying, or perhaps it's just the chaos around you is distracting everyone. Next time just speak louder.

UM 66 Unusual Event

In trying to rally your followers (which may or may not work), you manage to get yourself all fired up. With a rush of adrenaline and positive energy you feel invincible, and scared of nothing! You get +20 to Fear RRs today, and +5 hits.

76 - 100 Partial Success

Your message comes out as a jumble of words, but manages to  have a positive effect on your followers. Reduce fear by 1 severity.

101 - 175 Success

Well spoken Commander! Your soothing words calm your men, who are proud to be following your lead. Reduce fear by 2 se -verities.

176 + Absolute Success

You give an awe-inspiring speech that makes even foes consid -er (however briefly) joining your worthy cause. Men scared to tears are once again ready to take up arms beside you. Reduce fear by 3 severities.

### 15. The Environment

The  lives  of  adventurers  are  often  filled  with  peril, as  trouble  creates  drama.  Rules for dealing with the hazards of life are detailed in this section. This ranges from hazards of the natural world to toxins, falling or having large objects dropped on you. Most mild ef -fects of the environment are already handled with the fatigue rules (Section 5.5), but rules for dealing with the hazards of life are detailed in this section.

#### 15.1. Biomes

Biomes are used in some skills (e.g., Survival) and are categorized by climate (arctic, temperate, tropical) and by rainfall (arid, semi-arid, humid) as shown in Table 15-1. The single-letter  codes  shown  in  the  table  are used in Creature Law and Treasure Law . Arid areas receive less than 10" of rain annually, ranging from hyper-arid  deserts  (1"  or  less  a  year)  to  shrublands. Semi-arid  regions  receive  10-40"  of  rain  annually. They are often grassland with extended dry seasons and a short rainy season. Humid regions receive more than 40" of rain annually, including monsoonal regions (short  periods  of  heavy  rainfall),  seasonal  variation (e.g. wet winters or summers), as well as high yearround precipitation (as in a rainforest). Humid regions are nearly always forest.

These  are  broad  categories;  each  biome  can  have sub-biomes, although those are not detailed here (e.g., temperate forests could be mixed, dry coniferous, or rainforests). Alpine biomes are typically made up of types  of  forest,  shrubland  and  tundra,  depending  on elevation as well as climate and rainfall.

#### 15.2. Drowning

Characters may need to swim underwater or attempt to  avoid  inhaling  poisonous  gasses  by  holding  their breath. A  character  who  has  had  a  chance  to  take  a breath first may hold it for 12 rounds (1 minute) plus or minus the character's Constitution bonus in rounds (minimum  of  1  round).  Each  subsequent  round  the character  must  make  an  Absolute  Maneuver  using their Endurance modifier (Body Development skill bo -nus plus any racial Endurance modifier). A successful Adrenal Focus maneuver will add +25 until the Body Development maneuver is failed. The maneuver starts off Easy (+20) and increases 1 difficulty each round. If the character does not get a chance to prepare (thrown into water unexpectedly, sudden poison gas explosion on top of him, etc.), then the character can only hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Consti -tution bonus before rolling every round (minimum of 1 round).

A failed check means that the character takes a breath and is affected by any toxins in the air. If underwa -ter  or  in  an  airless  environment  the  character  takes 1d10 hits per round and must make an Endurance roll each round. In addition, characters inhaling water are Stunned[-50] until they are able to clear their lungs. Treat as respiratory arrest (Section 13.2).

#### 15.3. Extreme Temperatures

Being exposed, even for short periods of time, to ex -treme  temperatures  (below  -50°F  /  -49°C,  or  above 200°F  /  100°C)  without  appropriate  protection  can cause serious harm. For each round a character spends in an extreme environment, roll a Cold or Heat critical as indicated on Table 15-3. The GM is the final arbiter of  what  is  appropriate  protection;  it  may  be  reason -able to scoop up a handful of hot coals wearing a thick leather glove, but the same glove would offer little or no protection in attempting to grab a scoop of lava. The GM should inform the character if the protection used will work or not before the action is taken, unless the character simply does not know due to lack of ex -perience.

Coming into contact with frost effects, usually in the form of extremely cold liquids or gasses (e.g., certain pressurized gases, liquid nitrogen, arctic waters or mag -ically cold substances) or fire or other hot substances (e.g., lava or steam) can cause immediate damage. The GM will need to consider how large and how cold or hot the frost or heat is, how much contact was made with the target, and how well the target's clothing or covering protects him to determine the critical level

to use. If the e x t r e m e temperature, frost,  or  heat affects only a specific part of the body, take the closest lower critical result that affects that body part (treat as a Called  Shot, Section  9.7). The table in -dicates  Cold or  Heat  crit -icals, howev - er some substances may have their own critical tables (e.g., Steam) which should be used instead.

Some sources may be so small or weak that the GM can ignore them or inflict hits to reflect the damage taken (e.g., a lit match, candle, or a small chunk of dry ice). Frost or heat that is weak or only affects a small area of the character may inflict an A critical, while intense frost or heat that bathes the target's entire body would inflict an E critical or worse.

#### 15.4. Falling

Characters can jump or be thrown from heights, fail a climbing maneuver, or otherwise fall. Roll an attack on  the  falling  character  on  the  Crush  table,  with  an Attack  size  equal  to  the  falling  character's  size  and an  OB of +1 per foot fallen (reduce the falling dis -tance  by  the  height  of  the  character  if  they  deliber -ately  jumped  down).  Only  magical  effects  apply  to one's DB; Quickness does not help a falling character. However, characters may use the Acrobatics skill to attempt to control the fall; on a Success, the severity of any resulting critical is reduced by one, and by two on an Absolute Success.

#### 15.5. Falling Objects

Falling objects can be a natural hazard, the result of a trap, or dropped by a foe from above. These rules are for objects falling under the force of gravity; for objects thrown or hurled with force, the normal attack rules should be used.

The falling object makes a roll on one of two attack tables. For objects smaller than the target, use the rock attack table. A shield may be used, treating the falling object as a ranged attack, making it difficult to hit an aware and mobile target with a single dropped object. If the falling object is large enough compared to the target that it is attacking the whole area the target is in (like the whole ceiling coming down, or an avalanche) it uses the Crush table instead, and a shield cannot be used against it; the only defense is to get out of the way.

The effective OB of the attack is the length of the fall (in feet), while DB is counted normally. The weight of the dropped object determines the size of the attack (Table 9-4a).

Example: An elephant (Huge) falls on Taor (Medium) from 30'. Taor takes a +30 Huge Crush attack (3 size difference), which will result in +3 critical severities. Poor Taor!

#### 15.6. Poison &amp; Disease

Disease or poison will strike nearly everywhere at one time or another. Diseases may be the result of a ran -dom event, a spell, or a decision by the GM that there is a chance of disease. Poison might be delivered by spoiled food, a hostile creature, a sinister trap, or an assassin.

A target who has been exposed to poison or disease must make a Resistance Roll (Section 5.6) or suffer the effects based on how much it was failed by. This is often a penalty which may be treated and recovered from, just like injuries. After the duration of the poison or disease, a recovery roll is rolled using the Poison/ Disease column on the recovery table (Section 13.1). Some severe diseases may require healing or poisons require cures before recovery is possible.

Effects are cumulative, so that a victim beset with two impairments - one reducing his activity by -20 and the other by -15 - is actually at -35. A victim expe -riencing more severe effects must also weather all the lower severity effects in the same category.

The area affected by a poison is often determined by the situation (picking a lock with a needle trap affect -ing a hand) or any relevant critical (e.g., a critical strike indicates that the snake injects the nerve poison in the victim's leg). However, if location is not determined, or if a disease only affects a specific location, make an UM roll on any critical chart and use just the location to determine the part of the body affected.

Example: Dame Eloise Beranger is touched on the shoulder by King Midas, whose touch inflicts a level 10 conversion poison. Eloise fails her RR by 62, resulting in Severe symptoms. The GM decides to roll 5d10 to determine the onset time of mild symptoms, and then multiply that result by two and four for the moderate and severe symptoms. After 23 minutes, she is feeling distinct queasiness, cramps, and an upset stomach, and is at -20. The healer notes her skin is beginning to take on a bright luster. In another 23 minutes, queasiness gives way to nausea and her muscles are cramping as fibers turn to gold; her total penalty is now -70, during the rounds when she is able to act. If the poison is not treated within another 46 minutes, whole sections of her body will turn to gold, her activity penalty will increase by a further -51 to -100, and she will fall unconscious in another 1-50 rounds.

##### Poisons

The  use  of  poisons  can  add  spice  and  intrigue  to  a game.  Some  characters  use  them  to  coat  weapons, while others perish after ingesting a tasty but poison -ous  draught.  Their  hidden  dangers  are  frightening. Poisons  come  in  many  forms  and  are  grouped  into seven effect categories: Circulatory, Conversion, Muscle, Nerve, Paralytic, Reduction, and Respirato -ry.  Table  15-6a  gives  general  effects  of  poisons  that should cover most needs. Example poisons and details of their application are provided in Treasure Law.

Circulatory poisons affect the blood and blood ves -sels, causing swelling and internal bleeding or blood vessel failure or blockage, sometimes resulting in lo -cal tissue death or organ failure.

Conversion poisons destroy tissue by turning it into something else. This could be as extreme as turning tissue into wood, stone, or gold.

Muscle poisons  directly  damage  the  muscle  and 'meat' of the target, causing swelling, and impairing of function of the affected area.

Nerve poisons either block electrochemical action of the nerves or directly damage nerve tissue, causing de -generation of control of the body up to and including death.

<!-- image -->

Paralytic poisons are a subclass of nerve poisons that target the peripheral nerves without damaging the cen -tral nervous system, rarely causing death, but reducing control of the body up to complete inability to move.

Reduction poisons  liquefy  tissue,  usually  to  make it  easier  for  the  attacker  to  drink  the  target  up  once they die. While similar to conversion poisons, these poisons don't actually change the substance of the af -fected tissues, merely breaking down solid tissue into liquefied form.

Respiratory poisons cause irritation and swelling of the throat, nasal passages and lung tissues, along with edema (liquid filling the usually open areas of the re -spiratory system) interfering with breathing.

##### Diseases

Diseases  are  categorized  according  to  type  based on effect and transmission as described below. Table 15-6b gives durations and effects for each type based on the severity of the affliction. The general de -scriptions and specific effects of certain diseases may vary  from  these  general  descriptions.  The  GM  will also assign a level based on the type and the situation.

Bubonic diseases include any viral or bacterial disease resulting  from  organisms that reside in the blood or other precious bodily fluids. They are often transmit -ted by flea bites or other bites (injection). Symptoms occur in 1-10 days.

Chemical 'diseases' include all forms of chemical de -pendence on (i.e., addiction to) herbs/drugs, alcohol, etc. or slow physical deterioration as a result of chem -ical alteration. Resistance rolls are required on over -

dose or withdrawal (acute symptoms) or as a result of long-term use (chronic symptoms, which should begin at a lower level). Chemical dependence requires con -tinued use or withdrawal symptoms will occur.

Septic infections occur as a result of dirt or other in -fectious material introduced to the body via a wound or  injury.  After  a  failed  recovery  check  involving an injury that broke the skin, the GM may require a disease RR (level based on virulence and how much infectious  material  is  involved,  at  an  additional  -20 for  burns).  Onset of symptoms starts in 2d10 hours. The level of the disease should be chosen based on the openness of the wound and the cleanliness of the treatment. In severe cases amputation may be required (Section 13.1).

Pneumonic diseases  include  any  viral  or  bacterial disease carried in the air (e.g., transmitted by mist or breath). Symptoms occur 1-100 hours after exposure.

Parasitic disease  is  an  infestation  of  the  body  by organisms  larger  than  bacteria  or  viruses  (amoebas, worms, etc.). They usually enter the body through the consumption of contaminated food or water, though parasites can sometimes enter directly through the skin or  via  a  trauma  like  a  bite  from  an  infected  animal. Onset of mild symptoms is quick, 2-20 hours, while more severe symptoms take longer, usually 2-20 days.

Gritty Poison &amp; Disease

The setting may call for poisons being treated in a more realistic  manner,  where  poisons  and  diseases do not care how much experience you have or what level you are. All characters and creatures are treated as level 5 against poisons and diseases (unless im -mune).

#### 15.7. Visibility

Many maneuvers are greatly affected by vision, and thus  lighting.  Skills  that  require  fine  manipulation require  ample  light,  as  do  complex  physical  maneu -vers, especially if terrain is irregular. Table 15-7 lists modifiers based on the amount of shadows. If sight is required for the maneuver, such as tracking or melee combat,  the  full  penalty  applies.  If  the  maneuver  is not based largely on sight, but vision is helpful (e.g., doing an acrobatic tumble in a tavern), use the second number (which is half the normal penalty). Enhanced senses (represented by talents) may also serve to offset these  penalties.  For  Stalking  maneuvers,  which  are opposed, the modifier is applied to the opponent's Per -ception roll, not the Stalking roll.

Light Sources : At a distance of 10', treat illumination by a candle as Shadowy conditions, torchlight as Dim Light, and a bright bonfire as Uneven Light. A single focused lantern will produce Uneven Light conditions to 10' in the illuminated area.

At  distances  of  10'  to  30'  from  the  light  source,  in -crease the level of darkness by one. From 30' to 100' increase the level of darkness by two, and from 100' to 300' increase it by three. For example, a torch results in Dim Light up to 10', Shadowy conditions out to 30', Dark conditions to 100', and Extremely Dark condi -tions to 300'.

Regardless of the brightness of light, if there are many objects  casting  shadows  from  a  single  light  source, visibility penalties may be increased further. For ex -ample, when carrying a torch through a dense forest at night, anyone hiding behind the trees will at least have the benefit of Heavy Shadows, even close to the light source.

Fog and Mist : Fog reduces visibility within its radius, depending upon its thickness, and gives a penalty to Perception rolls  as  indicated  in Table  15-7.  In  addi -tion, auditory perception checks for sounds emanating beyond visual range are modified by -20, due to the in -ability to localize sounds effectively. Fogs that include smoke (smog) will affect smell perception by -10 to -50 depending on how strong the smell.

Darkness and Blindness : For game purposes, blind -ness and complete darkness may be handled the same way. Characters who are blind or operating in magical darkness suffer modifiers as listed for dark conditions. Magical darkness is equivalent to an extremely dark night,  resulting  in  a  penalty  of  -70  unless  one  has Nightvision. Utterdark is absolutely dark and renders Nightvision useless; only Darkvision allows seeing in Utterdark conditions. These penalties may also be re -duced by Blind Fighting skill, although this skill will not permit purely visual activities (such as reading).

Light versus Darkness : Magical darkness completely hides non-magical sources of light, but is overcome by magical light. Utterdark spells suppress even magical light, except for Utterlight. Normal fires, torches, and the like will still produce heat in an area of magical darkness, and will continue to burn (and ignite com -bustible  materials),  but  will  not  produce  any  light. Upon exiting an area of suppressing darkness, normal or  magical  light  will  spring  up  again  (unless  extin -guished or expired in the meantime). Likewise, upon the  removal  of  a  suppressing  magical  (Utter)light, magical  (Utter)darkness  will  resume  if  not  expired. Actually eliminating, rather than suppressing, magical light or darkness requires dispelling it.

Nightvision : Nightvision allows an individual to see in the presence of extremely faint light. The light from the moon or candlelight is enough to allow them to see normally, and even on a moonless night their vision is  only  slightly  impaired. All  darkness  penalties  are reduced by 40, as shown in the Nightvision column of Table 15-7. If there is no light (i.e., underground, Utterdark,  etc.),  then  Nightvision  does  not  give  any benefit.  In  addition,  the  use  of  Nightvision  makes  a person  highly  susceptible  to  sudden  bright  light.  A very bright flash of light can stun an individual using Nightvision, giving a -25 modification to RRs against Sudden Light and similar spells. This only applies if the Nightvision is actually in use. Elves (for example) do not have extra vulnerability to Sudden Light in the middle of a sunny day. Nightvision does not reduce penalties or provide any benefit against fog.

Darkvision :  Darkvision is a magical form of vision that  allows  the  user  to  see  in  complete  (even  magi -cal Utterdark) darkness as if in optimal lighting con -ditions. The user is subject to the same penalties for bright light and fog as Nightvision.

For over four decades, Rolemaster has been the definitive fantasy role-playing game that combines realism and depth without sacrificing playability. Rolemaster Unified is the next evolution drawing upon the best elements of previous editions to create a streamlined and consistent game. Rolemaster Core Law is the cornerstone of Rolemaster Unified. Rolemaster Core Law is divided into three parts:

Character Law : A wide range of character creation choices - 22 professions, 23 races, 10 cultures, and a comprehensive system of talents and flaws. A system of 10 temporary and potential stats determined by using both assigned and random elements. A skill development system that allows a character to improve their skill capabilities without absolute restrictions. Complete, con -solidated and streamlined guidelines for resolving actions, magic and attacks.

Arms Law : the highly acclaimed combat system. Complete rules for melee, ranged and spell combat, with new effective mechanics for battling large and small monsters. 39 attack tables for weapons, animal, monstrous and spell attacks. 15 critical strike tables Acid, Cold, Electricity, Grapple, Heat,  Holy, Impact, Krush, Puncture, Slash, Steam, Strikes, Subdual, Sweeps, and Unbalance - providing injuries with explicit effects and descriptions.

Gamemaster Law : Helpful guidance on running the game with rules for healing, social skills, fear, and morale as well as environmental hazards, poisons and diseases. Rules and guidance on creating races, cultures and profes -sions using the fully balanced mechanics employed across Rolemaster Unified.
