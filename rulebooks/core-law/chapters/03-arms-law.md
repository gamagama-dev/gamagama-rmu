## Part II: Arms Law

Opposition and danger are essential parts of adventuring, and combat offers both. It may be a necessary goal to battle and defeat a particular foe, or it may be a last resort as the he -roes stalk through an accursed land, avoiding as many foes as possible on their way to a par -ticular  objective.  In  either  case,  Rolemaster combat offers danger and drama. Not merely a  process  of  attrition,  every  combatant  risks real and meaningful injury in every attack.

Combatants attack by making a high open-ended d100 Attack Roll and adding the skill bonus for the attack type (called the Of -fensive Bonus, or OB). Subtracted from this roll  is  the  defender's  Defensive  Bonus,  or DB. Additional modifiers may apply to one's Offensive  and  Defensive  Bonuses  based  on a  variety  of  factors  such  as  weapon  quality, cover, and each combatants' choices to parry, dodge, or block.

If  the  unmodified attack roll falls within the Fumble range of the attack (e.g., 1-7), then the attack Fumbles. A roll is made on the proper Fumble table based on the attack type.

If  the  attack  is  not  a  Fumble,  the  resulting total  is  looked  up  on  the  Attack  Table  for the attack/weapon, using the column for the defender's Armor Type (AT). The result will either be a miss, hits of damage, or hits plus a critical. The attack type determines the type of critical done. Exact results of a critical are determined  by  a  second  roll,  which  is  not open-ended  and  usually  does  not  have  any modifiers. Criticals cause injuries which can have both temporary and lasting effects such as bleeding or broken bones. Different types of injuries can be healed in different ways, but most require time to recover.

When combat occurs, time is divided into a series of rounds, each 5 seconds long, during which  each  combatant  performs  one  or  a few  actions.  Every  combatant  has  4  Action Points, with actions taking a variable number of  Action  Points  to  complete.  Melee  itself is  abstracted, with a round of melee combat representing a series of back and forth blows and parries rather than rolling to resolve each swing of the weapon.

### 8. The Combat Round

Combat occurs on a faster time scale than narrative parts of the game, with movement occuring over short distances and attacks happening quickly. To break up the  action  into  manageable  periods  and  to  simplify tracking  of  durations  for  spells,  injuries,  and  other effects, action occurs in time periods of five seconds, which  are  called  rounds.  Combatants  (characters, creatures, or other participants) normally perform one action in a round (e.g., attack or cast a spell), which may be combined with movement.

Most  combat  actions,  such  as  attacking  and  spell -casting,  often  take  the  entire  round.  However,  some actions may not take the whole round, permitting the combatant to take multiple actions. Each action is as -signed a number of Action Points (AP) to represent the time required. Combatants receive 4 Action Points ev - ery round (unless under the effects of  a  haste,  slow  or  stagger  effect) and spend 1 Action Point on an ac -tion in each Action Phase until they have none remaining. Within each Action  Phase,  the  order  in  which combatants  act  is  determined  by their Initiative (Section 8.3).

Movement  can  occur  as  its  own action or simultaneously with other actions.

#### 8.1. Actions

Actions  include  any  activity  the character performs including movement, spellcasting, melee, or retrieving  items  from  a  backpack. As  shown  in  Table  8-1,  some  ac -tions require a fixed number of Ac -tion Points, while others are given a range, such as 2-4. Actions with a range of AP can be performed more quickly at a penalty of -25 for each AP less than the normal maximum. An  action  resolves  once  enough Action  Points  have  been  spent  to complete it.

Example: Aeonahlia has a long bow (missile attack) which requires 1-3 AP. Aeonahlia may loose an arrow after spending 3 AP with no penalty or may fire after only spending 2 AP at a penalty of -25, or spending 1 AP for a penalty of -50.

An action which requires more than 1 AP will gen -erally be interrupted, and the AP lost, if the character expends AP on any other action before the first action is completed. Actions are not interrupted by the first instantaneous action in the round, which costs 0 AP. The GM may rule that certain actions may be partially completed and resumed later, in which case the AP are not lost.

##### Concentration

Concentration is different from other actions, as it is spread throughout the round taking focus away from everything  else.  When  concentrating,  every  Action Point  spent  only  counts  for  half.  Thus  2  AP  must be  spent  to  complete  a  1 AP  action.  (The  character

may  also  move  one  half  of  their BMR for 1 AP.) Many spells and some skills  require  concentration, including dodging  or defending against ranged attacks using one's Shield skill.

A  combatant  can  concentrate  on two  things  at  once  (double  con -centration),  however  this  requires a  Mental  Focus  maneuver  every round. No other action can be made aside  from  movement  at  a  Creep pace  (x1/2  BMR)  which  requires a maneuver roll. A movement ma -neuver  Failure  means  concentra -tion is broken for both things.

While stunned,  a  combatant  must make  a  Mental  Focus  roll  every round in order to maintain concentration (at the normal penalties for being stunned). A combatant who is  knocked  unconscious  has  con -centration immediately broken.

A Mental Focus roll is also required when  concentrating  for  extended periods of time (Section 5.5).

If under an effect which increases the  combatant's  AP  for  a  round, concentration still doubles the number of AP for all other actions, so it is always half the round. This represents the fact that if slowed or sped  up,  concentrating  still  takes half your attention and effort.

##### Directed Spells

Directed spells are treated as casting a spell (2-4 AP), but the attack (using the Directed Spell skill) is includ -ed in this action (often a ranged attack such as Shock Bolt). Any penalty for using less than the maximum of 4 AP for casting is applied to both the spellcasting roll and the attack roll.

##### Instantaneous Actions

Some actions occur so quickly they are treated as in -stantaneous. Any action that costs 0 AP is an instanta -neous action and only the first instantaneous action in a round costs 0 AP (and thus a 'free' action taking no time during the round). Some spells may be counted as such, which will be clearly indicated in the spell de -scription. Other actions may also occur instantly, such as  dropping an item or yelling out to someone. The first instantaneous action takes 0 Action Points (even if Concentrating), however any further instantaneous actions  performed  that  round  take  1  AP  each  (2  if Concentrating). This represents the fact that no action is strictly instantaneous. The time required still adds up; it is also difficult to split one's attention between multiple actions in a 5 second period.

peRception

A human-like combatant will generally be aware of everything going on within a 10' radius hemisphere directly to his sides and in front of him. Helmets can restrict this field of view, while spells or abilities can increase it. Combatants not engaged in melee will normally be focused on the closest foes ahead of them, even beyond this distance, if their view is not blocked by allies or cover. Combatants are not automatically aware of what is going on in the distance, or to their rear  or  flanks,  unless  it  is  large  and/or  spectacular. (You may casually notice a fireball going off or a drag -on dropping into the melee 50 feet away; those sorts of 'everyone notices' events are at the GM's discretion.) When in doubt whether something is obvious to all combatants,  the  GM  may  call  for  a  passive  Percep -tion maneuver (as a free action) to determine wheth -er  combatants  are  aware  of  these  relatively  obvious features of the battlefield. A character may choose to take a Perception action (i.e., taking a quick glance to look  around  or  spending  several  seconds  to  analyze the complete battle) in order to make out more details of the situation, spot hidden foes, and otherwise avoid being taken by surprise. A Perception action using 0 AP is at -50 (2 AP less than normal) and is an instan -taneous action. Thus a 0 AP Perception action may not be made after another instantaneous action in a round (just perform a 1 AP Perception action at -25).

##### Round to Round Actions

A few actions may require more than 4 AP such as donning or removing armor, or picking a complicated lock. These actions take multiple rounds to complete and must usually be performed uninterrupted by other actions  (although  they  may  be  combined  with  other actions such as movement). It is up to the GM whether an  action  can  be  resumed  later  or  must  be  restarted from  the  beginning  (e.g.,  removing  armor  could  be done  over  multiple  separated  actions  with  interrup -tions, but being interrupted while picking a lock may require you to start again).

##### Spell Casting and Preparation

Casting a spell takes 2-4 AP, except for those spells which are instantaneous and require 0 AP (or 1 AP if not the first instantaneous action in the round). Only one spell may be cast per round.

In some cases a caster may want a hand free for spell -casting (details of spellcasting may be found in Spell Law ).  A caster with a two-handed weapon (e.g., a staff) may freely hold that weapon in one hand and use the other hand for casting; this requires no AP and is part of the spellcasting action. A caster with a one-handed weapon or shield in each hand will need to sheath it (1 AP) or shift one item to the other hand (1 AP) in order to free one hand for casting.

Spellcasters often spend time gathering magical ener -gies and focusing the mind to cast. This is called spell preparation and requires the caster to concentrate. Each round of preparation requires a round of concentration (doubling the cost of any other action that round as normal), while casting the actual spell is a separate 2-4 AP action in a round following a preparation round. You cannot concentrate to prep and cast a 2 AP spell in the same round x2 for 4 AP, as the preparation action must be complete before the spell casting action, not simultaneous with it. If the caster drops his preparation concentration for a full round without casting a spell, then all benefit from accumulated preparation rounds is lost (the caster does not lose any PP, he merely does not have that power balanced on the edge and ready to go anymore).

Multiple Spells in a Round

Multiple spells may be cast in a single round, if a character has enough activity. Each additional spell cast in a round is at a cumulative  -50 penalty. There -fore, the second spell cast is at -50, the third -100, etc.

This optional rule can greatly increase the power of spellcasters in the game and the GM should consider it carefully before including it.

#### 8.2. Tactical Movement

Movement is a unique action during the combat round, because it is often combined with other actions, such as  casting  a  spell  while  moving  forward,  advancing while drawing a weapon, or charging into combat.

A character may take a movement action, typically ex -pending 1 AP to move up to their base movement rate (BMR). A character with no more than a 15% load, who moved at least half their BMR in the previous action phase, may move up to 1.25x their BMR in one action phase. A character moving more than 4x their BMR in a round (i.e., moving a maximum of 1.25x their BMR in each action phase) will require 4 AP plus their  instantaneous  action.  Characters  and  creatures who are more heavily encumbered or who otherwise have a maximum pace must limit their total movement for  the  round  as  listed  on  Table  5-3  (repeated  here from Chapter 5). For example, a character with a 48% load, limited to a Jog pace, may move their full BMR for only two phases (2 AP).

Alternatively, a character may choose to move up to a Run pace while taking other actions. In this case, there is no AP cost for the movement, but actions performed while moving will suffer a Pace Penalty based on the farthest distance they moved during any phase of the action.

Example: Nealla (BMR of 20'/round) needs to move 40' to get her target within range of her spell. She expends 1 AP to move her BMR in the first phase, and then another 1 AP to move her BMR again in the second phase, then spends her remaining 2 AP in the third and fourth phase to cast her spell (at -50). Note that she could instead move at a Jog pace while casting for the full round (moving half of her BMR in each phase), and the pace penalty would result in the same -50 modifier. In most cases, it is simpler and yields the same results to spend AP on a movement action rather than acting while moving.

Example: Nealla needs to cast her spell as quickly as possible. In the first Action Phase, she begins her spell

(1  AP)  and  moves  10' (one half of her BMR, a Jog pace). In the second Action Phase, she moves 10' further and completes  her  spell  (1  more AP).  She  casts  the  spell at a -50 penalty for only spending 2 AP on the action  and  -50  for  moving 10' per phase, for a total of -100.

A combatant with more than 4 AP (e.g., due to Adrenal Speed) may expend additional AP during the action to  move their BMR for each additional AP, with no additional pace penalty. For example, a character with 6 AP could expend 2 extra AP to make a 4 AP attack while moving x4 BMR with a -50 pace penalty.

A character making a melee or thrown weapon attack may reduce the pace penalty by their Combat Exper -tise: Footwork skill.

Example: The very quick Sedgewick (BMR of 30'/ round) moves to attack his foe. On the 1st action phase, he moves 10' and begins his attack (1 AP), and continues the same in the 2nd action phase. His foe is backing up so he rushes, moving 20' (a Run pace) in the 3rd action phase while completing his attack. His attack suffers a -25 penalty for being completed in 3 AP, and a pace penalty of -75. Sedgewick's Footwork skill is +40, reducing the pace penalty to -35, for a total penalty of -60.

##### Opposed Maneuvers

Even in a game using strict movement rules and min -iatures, conflicts are bound to happen where it may not be clear which combatant should get the advantage. In these cases maneuver rolls should be made by both combatants. Pick one to be active (usually one trying to gain an advantage somehow) and one to be passive (trying to prevent the advantage) and treat as conflict -ing skills (Chapter 3).

Example: Sedgewick has been spotted by the guards and wants to escape. He makes a break for the exit, but unfortunately one of the guards is in the way, trying to intercept him. Fortunately, the guard hasn't had time to draw his sword or begin an attack. The GM decides to use a conflicting Running Absolute Maneuver. If Sedgewick is successful, he will get past the guard; if unsuccessful, the guard delays him.

##### Melee Range

The abstract nature of the tactical round means that a combatant's position is not precisely defined. Com -batants are constantly moving, not standing in place waiting for their turn. It is assumed that a combatant occupies or controls a circle whose radius is equal to half of the character's height. This 'combat zone' rep -resents the set of locations that the combatant might occupy at any given time during the round.

A combatant's melee range is the range that a character can target with a melee weapon. Its radius is the char -acter's combat zone plus the length of the character's weapon. For example, a 6' tall combatant wielding a 3' axe will have a (6 / 2) + 3 = 6' melee range. A character can make a melee attack against a target as long as the defender's combat zone is within the attacker's melee range.

##### Closing &amp; Charging

Closing occurs any time a combatant gets within me -lee combat range of another combatant and has spent enough Action Points to resolve a melee attack (per -haps at a penalty if fewer than 4 AP are used). Each of the two combatants may parry as normal (Section 9.6) if they have spent at least 1 AP on a melee action at the time the attack is resolved.

If a combatant closes into melee at high speed, then he has the potential for a more damaging blow. This is called  charging,  which  sacrifices  accuracy  (reflected in  the  pace  penalty)  in  favor  of  power. The  Combat Expertise:  Footwork skill will reduce the penalty as noted previously under Tactical Movement. A success - ful charge increases the size of the attack (Section 9.4) based on the total distance traveled in the round before resolving the attack as shown in Table 8-2. Note that it is not normally possible to attack while moving at a  Sprint  pace;  this  will  require  special  circumstanc -es, additional AP from Adrenal Speed or Haste, or a mount.  If  one  combatant  is  moving  away  from  the other, the difference in speed is used to determine the effective pace for purposes of a charge; if moving to -wards each other, use the combined speed. Pole arms

can be braced against a  charge  as  part  of the attack action by a stationary combatant, thereby gaining the same  bonus  to  size for  an  attack  against a charging combatant.

| Table 8-2: Charging   | Table 8-2: Charging   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Speed                 | Size                  |
| Jog (x2 BMR)          | +1                    |
| Sprint (x4 BMR)       | +2                    |

Example: The dwarf Hildrikki (BMR of 20'/round) spots her prey from 50' away. She draws her axe and charges into combat. On each of the first three Action Phases, she moves 15' and spends her Action Point preparing her attack. On the fourth Action Phase, she moves the remaining 5' and completes her attack, which is resolved with a pace penalty of -75 (for a Run pace); Hildrikki' s Footwork skill of +40 reduces the penalty to -35. Since she moved more than twice her BMR during her attack, it is treated as one size greater. If the GM decides the terrain is rough, she may also require a Running maneuver roll (a Percentage Maneuver) to determine if Hildrikki actually closes the full distance, and suffers no mishaps en route.

##### Withdrawing

A combatant may retreat cautiously out of his foe's melee  range  by  moving  backwards.  His  speed  is halved and he may not move faster than a Jog pace. His opponent will need to advance in order to continue an attack against him.

The withdrawing combatant may also turn and run, in which case his opponent may choose to pursue and it will become a chase. If his opponent has already spent at least 1 AP on an unresolved attack and does not wish to pursue, the opponent may immediately spend their next AP (if they have any left) to resolve the attack based on the total number of AP used for the attack. This counts as their action for their next action phase. Whether the opponent makes an immediate attack or chases, they will receive the bonus for a rear attack (see Section 9.5).

Example: Xavain is battling the orc Grodak, but things are looking grim and he decides to run. Grodak has won initiative, however, and in the first action phase begins an attack. Xavain takes his chances and bolts. Grodak chooses not to pursue, but merely expends his next AP to resolve a 2 AP attack with the bonus for a rear attack. Assuming he survives, on the second action phase Xavain may take another action, but Grodak has already spent his AP for the second action phase and cannot begin his next action until the third action phase. If Xavain had won initiative and fled on the first action phase, Grodak would have needed to pursue and keep up with Xavain in order to strike him.

##### Passing Through

Passing  through  an  opponent's  melee  range  can  be dangerous. If you enter and leave the opponent's me -lee  range  within  a  single Action  Phase,  you  may be attacked or blocked. This may also be applied in cases where  a  combatant  attempts  to  circle  around  a  foe while remaining inside their melee range.

Your opponent may attempt to interpose themselves to block your movement. Resolve this as a conflicting absolute  maneuver  of  Running  or  other  appropriate skill with the character passing through as the active party. If you are one size larger than your opponent, it  is  Sheer Folly (-50) to stop you, two or more siz -es  larger  is  impossible  (e.g.,  a  human  cannot  stop  a galloping horse by getting in its way). If you are suc -cessful, you may continue your movement normally. Otherwise, your movement for the phase ends within your foe's melee range and you will not be able to get past your foe this round.

Additionally, if your movement is not stopped, you are treated as withdrawing (see previous section). There -fore, if your opponent has already expended at least one AP on an unresolved melee attack when you pass through their melee range, and has not used all of their AP for the round, they may elect to spend their next AP on an immediate melee attack against you, which will be treated as a rear attack.

Example: Pelastora the Swift is rushing Vjekan the necromancer, but one of Vjekan's foul skeletons is in the way. Pelastora has +80 Running and has won initiative, while the clumsy skeleton has only +20. Both begin attack actions in the first action phase, the skeleton with the intent of gutting Pelastora, and Pelastora hoping to stab Vjekan. In the second action phase, Pelastora tries to sprint past the skeleton; the skeleton rolls 58 for a total of 78, giving Pelastora a +22 bonus, and Pelastora rolls 32 for a total of 32 + 80 + 22 = 134. She easily zips past the skeleton, but not before it takes a swing at her.

Fortunately, it has only spent 2 AP on the attack, resulting in a -50 penalty on the attack. Pelastora can continue her attack action and movement in the third and fourth action phases. The skeleton's attack was completed on the second action phase, but it may begin a new attack on the third action phase if it will be able to reach a foe.

#### 8.3. Round Sequence

The  tactical  round  simulates  real-time  actions  by roughly  ordering  the  characters'  actions  based  on when they would occur, with actions that take more Action Points resolving later in the round. The 5 sec -ond round is divided into 4 roughly equal increments each represented by an Action Phase.

Tactical rounds should always be used when anyone initiates an attack, but the GM may decide to start us -ing rounds for other time-sensitive situations (e.g., a character has 40 seconds [8 rounds] to slide down a drain pipe, sneak down the alley, open a door and slip inside before the patrolling guard comes back).

The combat round is played out in multiple phases:

- Initiative Phase : Combatants determine their initia -tive order.
- Action Phases :  Each combatant receives 4 Action Points. During each of the 4 Action Phases, each combatant may spend an Action Point on an ac -tion. Once enough Action Points have been spent on an action (Table 8-1) it may be resolved.
- Upkeep Phase :  Ongoing effects, such as bleeding, spell durations, etc. are tracked.

##### Initiative Phase

As  conditions  can  change  during  combat,  initiative is rolled anew every round and determines the order in which combatants resolve their actions during the Action Phases. The initiative is a 2d10 roll plus Quick -ness bonus (once). Penalties that apply to all actions, including spell effects, wounds, fatigue, loss of hits, encumbrance, etc. will affect initiative by -1 for every -10 penalty (round down).

Initiative = 2d10 + Qu - (1 for every -10 penalty)

Example: Hauser rolls a 14 on initiative, +1 for quickness bonus is 15.

Example: Moriah, after a series of unfortunate events, has a sprained ankle (-25), half her hits remaining (-20), is fatigued (-25), and encumbered (-5). This is a total of  -75 to all action, so Moriah will be at -75 / 10 = -7 initiative. She rolls a 15 - 7 = 8 for her initiative.

If  two  or  more  combatants  have  a  tie  on  initiative, they are resolved together and treated as if they were simultaneous (all are resolved, and none can affect or modify the results of the others).

A  combatant  may  voluntarily  reduce  their  initiative on  any  phase,  to  a  minimum  of  their  initiative  as  a negative  number.  For  example,  a  character  with  an initiative of 14 may reduce it as low as -14. This al -lows the character who won initiative the option to go last. If initiative is reduced in this way, it will remain at the lower value for the remainder of the round. A character may not lower their initiative and then raise it back up.

Surprise

Most  combats  begin  with  both  sides  aware  of  each other and prepared for combat, but if one or both sides are unaware of the other's presence, or not expecting combat, then surprise will  have  a  dramatic  effect  in the first round of combat. It is possible for people on the same side to have a different surprise status at the start  of  combat,  if  they  had  different  viewpoints  or Perception maneuver results in the round before com -bat started.

If  a  combatant  was  not  expecting  combat  and  was completely unaware of the attacker until combat start -ed, then he is caught flatfooted, and cannot perform any actions at all in the first round. If a combatant was not expecting combat, but was aware of the attacker's presence, or was unaware of the attacker but wary of being attacked, then the combatant may act, but loses his first 2 Action Points. A successful Perception roll can reduce this to losing his first Action Point.

Surprise and being flatfooted also incur modifiers on attacks  against  the  surprised  combatant,  see  Section 9.5 for details.

Example: Gauth, Pogs and Athlon walk into a tavern and sit at a table. Pogs gets up to get drinks. Athlon, ever suspicious, scans the crowd (rolls a Perception maneuver and succeeds) and sees the three Baylor brothers pushing through the crowd toward them. Remembering they had beaten the Baylor brothers in a brawl the week before, and that the brothers had sworn revenge, Athlon knows this is trouble and says 'Fight' as he starts to stand. The GM declares combat is starting as the three Baylor brothers get close enough to attack. Athlon is aware of the attackers and wary, so he is not surprised and rolls initiative normally. Gauth has been alerted to trouble by Athlon's comment, but has no idea what the problem is or who is attacking. Since he is wary, but unaware of his attackers, he is surprised (losing his first 2 AP). Pogs, walking back toward the table with three beers in his hands, is relaxed and not wary, and is unaware of his attackers, so he is caught flatfooted and does not get to roll initiative or perform any actions in the first round. Parco, a patron of the tavern standing between the Baylor brothers and the heroes' table, is looking at the Baylor brothers and so aware of them, but is not expecting the attack as they shove him out of the way, so he is aware of his attacker but unwary, resulting in surprise (losing his first 2 AP).

##### Action Phases

Each  round  contains  4  Action  Phases,  during  which each combatant, in initiative order, spends 1 AP on an action.  The  first  instantaneous  action  performed  in  a round (costing 0 AP) may also be resolved during any of the Action Phases. Action Points may not be saved for later phases, every combatant must spend 1 AP ev -ery phase if he has any left.

Combatants  may  have  bonus  Action  Points,  such as  through  the  use  of Adrenal  Speed,  in  which  case they may spend one additional Action Point per Ac -tion Phase starting with the last Action Phase (e.g., a combatant  with  two  extra Action  Points  may  spend one in the third Action Phase and one in the fourth). Combatants with negative Action Points, such as by being staggered, are simply unable to spend any more Action Points when they have run out.

When  enough  Action  Points  have  been  spent  on  an action  to  complete  it,  the  action  is  resolved,  usually by rolling an attack or an appropriate skill maneuver, although  some  mundane  actions  such  as  drawing  a weapon or simple movement may not require any roll.

Characters who have begun an action by spending AP are  not  required  to  complete  it  in  subsequent Action Phases, unless it is a melee action and they have already parried.  They  may  abort  the  action  and  immediately begin  on  a  new  action. Any AP  already  spent  on  the unresolved action are lost. If the combatant has parried, he  must  spend  enough AP  on  that  action  to  make  an attack with an OB of 0 or higher (even if he decides to not attack in the end, or is not able to because his foe has escaped, he must spend the Action Points).

Example: Hauser is fighting the elusive bandit Marula. Hauser's initiative was 12 and Marula's 14. On the first and second Action Phase, each combatant spends an Action Point on the attack. On the third Action Phase, Marula continues her attack, but Hauser decides to strike now rather than waiting for Marula to hit him first. He resolves his attack immediately (for a penalty of -25). Marula is Staggered and sent sprawling. On the fourth Action Phase, Marula is unable to attack (having lost her last AP due to being Staggered). Hauser decides to draw his dagger so he can throw it next round if Marula flees.

Melee Actions

A melee action represents a combatant's focus on me -lee, whether they are taking a combat posture, bracing for attack, or actually engaged in melee. A character may take a melee action regardless of whether they are currently in melee, and doing so may be necessary if the combatant wants to parry a foe who is charging towards them or to strike a foe who is about to go run -ning past.

The target of the melee action need not be declared until the combatant chooses to resolve the action, at which point the target must be within melee range. A combatant may parry any number of combatants (Section 9.6) as long as his last Action Point was spent on melee.

Faster Rounds

If a faster paced round is desired, the number of Ac -tion Phases may be reduced to 2, or even 1. With 2 Action Phases, each combatant spends up to 2 AP on actions.

With  1 Action  Phase,  each  combatant  takes  all  of their  actions  and  movement  at  once.  Note  that,  by design, the pace penalty for moving while attacking is  normally  the  same  as  the  penalty  for  expending AP to move the same amount. For example, a Creep pace (moving half your BMR over the course of the round) incurs  no  pace  penalty  and  requires  no AP, while  Jogging  (moving  twice  your  BMR)  incurs  a -50 pace penalty or takes 2 AP, resulting in a 2 AP attack for the same -50 penalty. So, in many cases it will be easier to treat moving your half BMR as a free action, with each full increment of your BMR costing one AP.

With fewer Action Phases, more conflicts are bound to happen as each combatant is allowed to do more at  a  single  time.  If  conflicts  arise  use  the  Opposed Maneuvers rule (Section 8.2) to determine the out -come. Also, assume that combatants who have not yet acted may freely declare parry, dodge, and other defenses  including  instantaneous  spells  at  the  time they are attacked.

Unlike other optional rules, this rule may be used off and on as needed. Some combats, or even individual rounds,  may  not  have  as  much  chance  for  conflict (long distance missile combat, or initial rounds when two groups are far apart and closing with each other). In these cases rounds may be sped up by having the combatants spend more Action Points at once. With a  larger  number  of  combatants  within  close  quar -ters, using 4 Action Phases will provide the greatest amount of fluidity.

Conditional Actions

If the maximum Action Points have been spent on an action, but the combatant does not wish to resolve it, he may continue to hold it until some declared condi -tion occurs. The action is resolved when the triggered condition occurs (often on someone else's initiative).

Example: Anika has been hastened, giving her 6 AP this round, and she rolls an initiative of 18. On the first Action Phase, she steps around a corner for cover against some archers and spends her first AP on a melee attack. On the second Action Phase, she spends a second AP on a melee attack. She could now attack immediately at a penalty, but none of her foes come around the corner. On the third Action Phase, she spends two AP completing an attack (since she is Hasted) and the action could be complete, but still no targets. On the fourth Action Phase, she continues to hold this action because they'll come around the corner 'any time now.'

A held action  counts  as  concentration,  thereby  dou -bling  the Action  Point  requirements  of  all  other  ac -tions.  Thus  the  combatant  may  move  and  perform other actions, as long as he is still in a position to see the triggering event and complete the previously held action. Some held actions may, by their nature, pre -vent other actions from being performed (e.g., holding a  bow  in  firing  position  would  prevent  the  combat -ant  from  doing  anything else requiring their hands). Concentration cannot be maintained forever and will eventually cause fatigue (Section 5.5).

Example: Brundel draws an arrow on the first Action Phase (1 AP). He would like to shoot the first per -son to step through the door he was told to guard. He spends the next three Action Phases on this action, but has not actually fired yet. After the first round of waiting, Brundel can declare and resolve firing an arrow at no penalty (normally 3 AP) at anyone coming through the door on their initiative as if it were a 0 AP action. While waiting, he may take other actions, as long as he keeps concentrating on the held action.

Open Rounds

Some GMs may allow actions to cross over into the next round, thereby allowing Action Points spent in a previous round to count toward the total needed to resolve the action.

Example: Brundel begins the round by equipping his bow (1 AP) then getting  and  nocking  an  arrow  (1 AP). He wants to fire without penalty which requires 3 AP. He begins aiming and firing, but his attack is not resolved until the next round when he spends an additional Action Point in the first Action Phase.

<!-- image -->

##### Upkeep Phase

The last step in the round is to account for ongoing effects. During upkeep, the players and the GM should perform the following for all combatants:

-  Subtract hits due to bleeding.
-  Reduce the remaining duration of all spells or other non-stun, timed effects by 1 round. For spell ef -fects on combatants, only reduce the duration after the first round if the combatant had spent less than 2 AP before being affected.
-  Reduce stun effects 1 round, starting with the most severe  effect  (Stun  [-75],  Stun  [-50],  then  Stun [-25]) if the combatant had spent less than 2 AP before being stunned.
-  Remove  any  staggered  effect  if  the  combatant  has already lost their 1 AP.
-  Advance any environmental or other effects (e.g., a rising tide, or a spreading fire).

### 9. Attacks

Once  the  combatants  have  readied  their  weapons, come into contact with their foes, and expended their action points, it is time to determine the outcome of their attacks.

Attacks  are  resolved  like  other  maneuvers:  a  d100 open-ended (upward only) roll is made and the appro -priate attack skill bonus, called the Offensive Bonus (OB), is added. The target's Defensive Bonus (DB) is then subtracted from the total roll. There are a variety of modifiers to both the attacker's OB and the defend -er's DB depending on the nature of the attack and the actions of the defender.

The result is determined by consulting the appropriate weapon or attack table. Each attack table, determined by the weapon used, has one column for each Armor Type (AT). Look up the final attack roll for the appro -priate AT. The result will indicate either a miss or the number of hits delivered (e.g., 12), or the number of hits and a critical (e.g., 18AS). The critical result con -sists of two letters, with the first letter indicating one of 10 levels of severity (A through J) and the second letter indicating the type of critical delivered (e.g., K = Krush, S = Slash).

#### Fumbling

Each type of attack or weapon is given a fumble num -ber  which  represents  the  chance  of  mishandling  the attack.  If  the  unmodified  attack  roll  (i.e.,  the  actual number rolled,  no  skill  bonuses,  etc.)  is  equal  to  or less than the weapon's fumble number, a roll is imme -diately made on the appropriate fumble table (Chapter 10). Skilled combatants can reduce the chance of fum -bling. For every 5 ranks the character has in the attack skill being used, the fumble number is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

Example: Volosha is wielding a heavy flail (fumble of 10), with which she has 6 ranks. Since she has at least 5 ranks she reduces the fumble by 1, to an unmodified 9 or less. Unfortunately it does not matter; Volosha rolls a 4 and must immediately roll on the appropriate fumble table.

##### Absolute Hit!

If a combatant's total attack roll is over 175 then he gets a bonus to the critical roll of +1 for every 5 above 175, rounding up. This stacks with any other critical modifier (e.g., Slaying attacks and Ambush).

Example: Ghirin, confronted by the merciless Lord Golan and his guards, in a last act of desperation, grabs a nearby pole arm and swings wildly at Go- lan (who is wearing AT 10, full plate armor). Ghirin rolls a 100, followed by a 98, followed by an 89, for a total of 287. His unskilled melee skill of -25, stat bonus of -5, and Golan's DB of 23 brings the total attack to 234. Ghirin gleefully rolls his E puncture critical: an 87 + 12 bonus (234 is 59 points over 175, adding +12 to the critical roll) results in a 99. Lord Golan is no more.

9.1. Melee &amp; Ranged Attacks

A melee attack is an offensive strike against an oppo -nent with, optionally, some offensive capability sac -rificed for defense (parrying). The melee action rep -resents an exchange of blows which spans part or all of the round, not merely a single swing of a weapon. Each combatant is looking for the opportunity to land a solid blow, and the result of the attack roll describes the outcome of the best opportunity during the course of the action. Such attacks may be made using a melee weapon, natural weapons such as claws, or by an un -armed combatant with their bare hands or feet.

A ranged attack is usually a single shot, and cannot be used to parry, nor can it be parried. Ranged attacks take  less  activity  than  melee  attacks,  although  the combatant may still wish to take some time to aim. Most ranged attacks require some additional time to draw  a  weapon  (e.g.,  to  ready  a  throwing  dagger), ready a new missile (e.g., to load a bow), or load and prepare a weapon (e.g., to draw and load a crossbow).

9.2.  Directed Spells

Spells that resolve an attack roll vs. a single target are called directed spells (e.g., elemental bolts, phantasms that  make  attacks  against  a  foe).  This  can  include supernatural or innate ranged attacks. Breath attacks may be treated as bolts if directed against a single opponent, or as balls or cones if used as an area attack. Bolts can be fumbled on an unmodified roll of 01-02 (unlike other attacks, the fumble range is not reduced by the caster's skill ranks). If the bolt is produced by a spell, the caster has both a chance to fail the spell and a chance to fumble the bolt.

- Elemental Bolts : All types of elemental bolts, most commonly the result of spells. Water, Shock, Fire, Ice, Lightning .
- Illusionary  Attacks :  Some  types  of  Illusions  are able to make attacks against foes, in which case they use this skill as an Offensive Bonus.
- Hurling :  Telekinetic  force  can  be  used  to  launch objects as magically-driven weapons.

9.3.  Area Attacks

Area effect attacks (e.g., elemental balls, breath weap -ons) are not treated like other attacks, and there are no corresponding skills since aiming is of little importance in harming individual targets, it being more of an issue of hitting the right mass or area of targets. In -stead, the only modifier to the attack roll is the level of ranks in the originating spell list or, if an innate ability, the level of the creature. Defensive Bonus from Quick -ness applies as the combatants are assumed to have a split second to shield themselves from the attack, but dodging (Section 9.6) does not. Shields and cover only apply if they are between the center point of the attack (or the origin for cone attacks) and the defender.

For  ball  attacks,  one  target  may  be  specified  as  the primary target (and center point), who will be subject to  an  attack  that  is  +1  size  greater  than  normal.  For cone attacks, anyone along the centerline is subject to a +1 size attack. For all area effect attacks, targets that straddle an edge of an area effect receive the attack at -1 size.

Unless  otherwise  specified,  a  cone  is  1'  wide  at  the origin and spreads to a width of 5' per 10' of range. For example, a 30' long cone reaches a maximum width of 15'.

Area effect spells may be fumbled on an unmodified roll  of  01-02;  oil  flasks  and  similar  improvised  area effect weapons fumble on 01-04.

In some cases, most notably with thrown weapons that have an area effect (e.g., oil flasks, holy water, magical fire ball globes), it may be important to determine how accurately the center point was placed. The GM should apply  a  difficulty  based  on  the  precision  desired. A Percentage Maneuver is then made using the appro -priate  skill  (generally  Ranged  Weapon:  Thrown). A

result of 100 or more means the missile was placed where desired.  Anything  less  than a  100%  Success  indicates  it was off the target. Determine half the distance to the target and  take  a  percentage  equal to  100  -  the  percentage  of success.  Randomize  the  di -rection  by  using  a  d6  (hex facings),  d8  (square  grid)  or a d12 (clock-face).

Example: Caittina throws an oil lamp 50' at an oncoming group of six thugs that are spread out over a 20' diameter. Caittina has a +50 bonus in Thrown skill. The GM determines a lamp of this size will inflict an A critical in a 20 foot radius, with a +1 size (B critical) on the center target if one is aimed for. Caittina declines to throw it at a specific thug, and instead tries to catch them all in the radius, so makes a Medium Absolute Maneuver using her skill. Unfortunately she rolls a final result of a 40%. The Lamp/Bomb is off target. Half the distance of 50' is 25, and she missed by 100-40 = 60% of 25' = 15'. The GM decides to use clock face style directions with 12 being due behind and 6 being directly ahead of the thugs. Caittina rolls a d12 and gets a 6… the lamp bomb has landed 15' short of the thugs 35' away from her and in front of most of the thugs (she still manages to hit two of them in front for an A critical). At least the whole alley is on fire, giving Caittina a chance to run un -less the thugs are brave enough to cross the fire.

#### 9.4. Size

Most games are centered on medium-sized characters, which range from dwarves to elves. However creatures and races both large and small are common in most fantasy settings. Table 9-4a is used to determine the size based on average weight and height or length of the race. The primary consideration of size is weight, however all members of a race are treated as the same size. A human character does not get to be large just because he weighs 300 lbs.

A creature or character's total Hits are determined by their Base Hits (Body Development + Racial) multi -plied  by  the  Hit  Multiplier  as  shown  in  Table  9-4a. This  modification  is  applied  when  the  character  or creature is created, so that it does not need to be calcu -lated during combat.

| Table 9-4a: Sizes            | Table 9-4a: Sizes            | Table 9-4a: Sizes            | Table 9-4a: Sizes            | Table 9-4a: Sizes            | Table 9-4a: Sizes            | Table 9-4a: Sizes            |

When a critical is inflicted, adjust the severity of the critical based on the size of the attack and the size of the defender, using the modifiers shown in Table 9-4b. The  net  result  is  that  larger  combatants  will  inflict more severe criticals against smaller foes, and smaller foes will inflict less severe criticals against larger foes. If  a  critical  is  reduced  below  an A  severity,  find  the next lower result that affects the same area of the body on the A column and apply it (for more details, see Section 9.8).

However, smaller combatants are also harder to hit. For  each  size  category  smaller  than  the  attack,  they gain a +5 DB modifier as noted in Table 9-5 (in the next section). The size of a combatant's attack may be modified from his normal size via charging, magical or  other  effects.  This  affects  the  critical  adjustment, but not the DB modifier.

Example: A human (medium) attacks a halfling (small) with a broadsword. Due to the size differ -ence, the halfling gets a +5 DB bonus. The attack is rolled, resulting in an 11C result. Since halflings are small, the critical is increased one level from a C to a D. The final attack result is a 11D. The Halfling makes his broadsword attack and also gets an 11C result, but the critical is reduced one level from a C to a B. The final attack result is 11B.

Example: A human (medium) charging for a +1 size increase (Section 8.2) with a two-handed claymore (which attacks as a broadsword +1 size) attacks a Troll (big). The attack size is therefore Large so the critical severity is increased by two, but it is decreased by one due to the size of the troll. The target is larger than the attacker, so there is no DB modifi -er. If an 11C result is scored, it is increased to 11D.

Hits Adjustment Due to Size

Large  creatures  should  deliver  more  Hits  of  damage  than  a smaller creature if both are using the same attack (e.g., a claw of a raven vs the claw of a wyvern). The multiplier in the 'Hits Delivered' column of Table 9-4a may be used to multiply the hits delivered based on the size of the attack.

The Hits Delivered column differs from the Hit Multiplier col -umn only for ease of on-the-fly calculations.  If  additional  de -tail is desired and multiplying by 2/3 or ¾ is acceptable, the Hit Multiplier column may be used for hits delivered instead. The included Small and Big tables incorporate these modifiers (x0.75 for Small, x1.5 for Big).

Range Adjustment Due to Size

Much as with hit adjustments, multiplying range increments by the Hits Delivered or Hit Multiplier columns on the range table will  more  accurately  reflect  the  physics  of  larger  and  smaller ranged weapons.

##### Wrong-Sized Weapons

Combatants  will  normally  prefer  to  wield  weapons that are properly suited to their size but in the heat of battle may be forced to grab whatever is at hand. In general, treat the attack as being of the weapon's size (e.g., a broadsword made for a halfling makes a Small attack while a two-handed claymore made for a hal -fling makes a Medium attack). A -20 penalty applies when using a wrong-sized weapon.

A combatant may wield a smaller weapon in one hand, even if  it  was  designed  for  two-handed  use.  Even  a two-handed weapon made for a goblin will be smaller and  lighter  than  a  typical  one-handed  weapon  for  a human.

A combatant may wield a weapon that is one size larg -er, if it was designed for one-handed use, but it will require  two  hands.  Larger  two-handed  weapons,  or any weapon more than one size too large, may not be used at all. (As an exception, a dagger that is one size too large is approximately the size of a broadsword, so the GM may choose instead to treat it as a broadsword of the character's size.)

Example: Bahs, a human wielding a two-handed spear, is attacked by a troll wielding a one-handed club. In an unlikely series of events, both combatants fumble their weapons. The troll grabs the spear while Bahs gets the club. Bahs picks up the 12 lbs club with some difficulty, but manages to swing it with both hands. It makes a Big attack at -20. The troll finds the spear a bit puny and holds it in one hand to also make a Big attack at -20.

Armor and shields made for larger or smaller creatures are not normally usable without significant modifica -tion by a craftsman.

#### 9.5. Offensive Bonus

A character's base Offensive Bonus (OB) is his skill bonus with his weapon or attack, subject to various modifiers. The modifiers vary depending on whether it is a melee attack or a ranged attack as given in Table 9-5. In addition to these modifiers, all of the normal modifiers to one's skill apply as well:

-  Penalties due to injury (e.g., losing 25% or more of one's hits or suffering a penalty to all actions due to a critical) reduce the attacker's OB.
-  If  the  attacker  uses  less  than  the  maximum Action Points for his attack, he suffers the normal penalty of -25 for each Action Point less than the maxi -mum used.
-  If the attacker is moving while attacking, he suffers a Pace Penalty (Section 8.2: Tactical Movement).
-  Penalties due to fatigue, from failed Endurance rolls.

##### Facing and Flanking

Each  combatant  has  four  facings:  front,  two  flanks (left  and  right),  and  rear.  A  character  will  normally only  attack  (or  defend  against)  an  opponent  in  his front  facing,  although  with  a  penalty  he  can  attack other facings. For humanoids facing equal-sized op -ponents, there are six positions around a combatant: three in front (180 degrees), two flanks (left and right 60 degrees each), and a single rear facing (60 degrees). If a character is moving, his front facing is determined by the direction of travel. Otherwise, if a character is making an attack or parrying, his facing is usually de -termined by the position of the target (i.e., as the target moves, the character may turn to face the target imme -diately  during  the  target's  movement).  When  facing multiple  opponents,  a  character  can  choose  which one to follow, although with intelligent foes working together this will nearly always mean one foe will get a flank or rear attack. When in doubt, resolve with a conflicted  Running  absolute  maneuver  against  each additional  foe;  Failure  means  they  are  to  your  rear, Success on your flank, and Absolute Success permits you to keep them in your front arc.

Melee combatants attacking from the flank or rear re -ceive a bonus (+15 for flank or +35 for rear), and in addition, the foe cannot use a shield against the attack. Sometimes, however, a combatant may wish to attack or parry against an opponent to his flank or even rear facing. For example, a combatant might find himself stuck  between  a  swordsman  and  an  archer.  He  can choose to face the archer (to gain the benefits of his shield) while attacking the swordsman now in his rear facing. Attacks made to the flank or rear suffer a penal - ty of twice the positional modifier (to the flank is -30, to the rear is -70).

The  Combat  Expertise:  Reverse  Strike  skill  can  be used to offset the penalties to attacks declared against targets to the flank or rear, or it can reduce the posi -tional bonus an enemy would receive when attacking at a ratio of 2:1 (for every +2 bonus in Reverse Strike the positional modifier can be reduced by 1). If used against multiple foes, first divide the character's skill by the number of foes (rounding down), then reduce the penalties. In order to use the skill in this way the combatant must be actively in combat and be aware of the attacker.

Example: Anika has a Reverse Strike skill of +70 and is being attacked by one thief from behind, but cannot turn around because she stepped in a glue trap on the floor. Anika could reduce the thief' s rear facing bonus to 0 (half her Reverse Strike bonus of +70 is equal to the rear attack bonus of +35), or Anika could instead choose to let the thief get the full rear bonus, and reduce her own attack penalty to (70 - 70) = 0, or any combination thereof.

##### Restricted Quarters

As a general rule, if a combatant is fighting in an area smaller than his melee range, he should suffer a penalty due to restricted quarters. This is due to a smaller area to  maneuver in, difficulty in swinging a weapon, etc. Clearance is not as important as one's ability to maneu -ver, but for some long weapons it can be a more serious problem.

It is ultimately up to the Gamemaster to determine the penalty based on how restricted the combat is, taking into account the size of the room or area, allies, foes, ceiling  height,  furniture,  weapon  type  being  wielded, etc.  There  are  four  categories  of  Restricted  Quarters: Close (-25), Cramped (-50), Tight (-75), and Confined (-100). The Restricted Quarters penalties could also ap - ply to the use of ranged weapons, such as the use of a sling in a low cave. The Battle Expertise: Restricted Quarters Fighting skill can be used to offset these penalties.

Example: Jakko, a human warrior, chases some goblins into a cave. Jakko is 6' tall with a 4' sword, so his melee range is (6/2) + 4 = 7'. At first the 10' cave is fine, but as he continues to chase the goblins, it narrows to 6' high and wide. Now his head is brushing the ceiling, he cannot raise his sword over his head, and he has to be wary of clipping walls. The GM decides this is 'close' and imposes a -25 penalty. Chasing the goblins further into a 4' high and wide section, Jakko is now crouched over, and his swing is further impeded to 'cramped' and -50. Further on he enters into a 3' high and wide section, and is now using one hand to half crawl and reduced to waving his blade in narrow arcs for 'tight' or -75. Finally he crawls into a 2' high and wide section, he moves on his belly, and he is reduced to cramped stabbing motions, so the GM rules the conditions 'confined' or -100. Note that the goblins would likely have no problems in the 6' section (unless wielding long pole arms), but even they would be struggling with restricted quarters by the time the cave is reduced to 2'.

##### Surprised or Flatfooted

When executing attacks on surprised foes, the attacker gets +25 OB, in addition to any posi -tional  modifiers (if  melee). Against flatfooted foes,  the  bonus  is  +60:  +25  for  surprise  and +35  for  an  automatic  rear  attack,  regardless of position. (See Section 8.3 for the definition of  surprise  and  flatfooted.)  This  represents the combatant being able to freely hit his foe wherever desired, even if in front. In addition, a flatfooted foe cannot benefit from a shield, although any magical or armor quality bonuses would still ap -ply. Note that ranged weapons do not get the automat -ic rear attack bonus since ranged weapons do not get positional modifiers. Surprised foes still get DB due to Quickness, but flatfooted combatants do not.

Example: Ord, an assassin of vile disposition, has become angered during a card game with the ever-cheerful Mhairi. Determined to have his revenge, Ord bides his time and ambushes Mhairi in the dead of night as she walks home. Ord catches the slightly drunk Mhairi completely flatfooted, giving him a bonus of +60. Fortunately for the ever-lucky Mhairi, poor Ord rolls and fumbles his sword, dropping it on his foot and alerting Mhairi. Foiled again!

#### 9.6. Defensive Bonus

A  combatant's  Defensive  Bonus  (DB)  represents dodging, parrying, shield use, and tactical advantag -es. A combatant's DB is determined by the factors in Table 9-5. As long as a combatant is able to move it always get its DB from Quickness, unless caught flat -footed. A flying combatant gets a bonus to its DB even in melee, as the extra dimension of movement is use -ful in dodging attacks. To use a shield, the combatant must be aware of the attack and be using the shield to defend against it.

It is possible to have negative DB due to a Quickness penalty. This does not represent foes jumping into the path of an arrow. Rather, the attack tables assume an average  foe  who  is  actively  trying  to  not  get  hit.  If the combatant is deficient in some way, attacks will be more effective against it than against an average foe.

coveR

Walls, curtains, fog and other combatants can all make it difficult to target a foe. Cover can provide DB modifi -ers against both melee and ranged attacks, and these are given in Table 9-5. Note that cover provides twice the modification against ranged attacks as it does against melee.

Hard cover consists of anything that can stop the attack outright (e.g., walls and trees) or deflect the shot (e.g., fences and bushes). Soft cover consists of anything that obscures vision, but does not interfere with the attack (e.g., fog, darkness, curtains). The GM is the final arbi -ter on how much cover an obstacle offers and whether the cover is hard or soft cover, based on the nature of the attack and the obstacle being used for cover.

To determine the amount of cover, consider how much of the defender is blocked from the attacker's view by the  cover.  If  the  attacker  cannot  see  a  quarter  of  the target, that is partial cover, if he cannot see half of the target, that is half cover, and if the target is 90% or more obscured, that qualifies as full cover. Small characters should be able to more easily find sufficient cover to protect  themselves,  while  Big  characters  may  have trouble finding anything big enough to hide behind.

Another combatant (enemy or ally) counts as hard cov -er if someone attempts to attack past one combatant to strike another combatant. The amount of cover is based on positioning and the relative size of the combatants. For example, attacks from the second rank are normally considered half hard cover, for a +40 DB bonus. Pole arms may be used more effectively when striking past cover and reduce the cover bonuses by half (i.e., half hard cover results in only +20 DB).

##### Dodging

A  combatant  may  attempt  to dodge  out of the way  of  attacks,  increasing  their  Defensive  Bonus. There are three types of dodging, representing differ -ent amounts of effort spent on defense. A combatant may benefit from only one type of dodging in a round. All  types  of  dodging  add  to  DB  against  all  melee foes the combatant is aware of for the entire round. Dodging can also be used against ranged attacks, but the DB value is halved, as the combatant must move away from where they anticipate the attack will go, or simply move in an unpredictable manner in order to be difficult to target; these attacks are typically too fast to focus on dodging the projectile itself. Dodging is not possible at all against area attacks.

Dodging utilizes  the  ranks  and  bonus  of  one  of  the Movement skills, depending on the environment. In normal land-based encounters use Running, in the wa -ter use Swimming, and while climbing use Climbing. If the combatant is currently moving using Acrobatics, the GM may allow that to be used as the appropriate Movement skill.

Passive dodging takes no action and adds the combat -ant's ranks in the appropriate Movement skill to their DB, up to a maximum of +50 DB. Passive dodging may not be combined with DB granted from passive use of a shield. Using the shield involves its own type of footwork as is represented by the Shield skill.

Partial dodging requires concentration and adds half the  combatant's appropriate Movement skill to their DB.

Full dodging takes 4 Action Points and adds the com -batant's full appropriate Movement skill to their DB. Encumbrance  and  armor  penalties  greatly  hinder dodging as they apply to the combatant's gained DB. These penalties apply in full to passive, partial, and full dodging, which means any moderate encumbrance or armor is often enough to nullify the much smaller passive bonus. If dodging ranged attacks, subtract all penalties first before halving the DB.

The DB bonuses for partial and full dodging are re -duced by any injury penalties which the character is suffering. As with other actions, partial and full dodg -ing are also reduced by the pace penalty if the charac -ter is moving.

##### Parrying

Combat in Rolemaster is quite deadly, and using parry is one of the best ways for a combatant to stay alive. Combatants who try to go full offense and never parry will be quite dangerous for the short time before they take  a  lethal  critical  and  die.  Generally,  only  mind -less or berserk combatants will completely disregard danger in order to strike out at a foe with all of their offense.

A  combatant  may  trade  offensive  capability  for  de -fense by spending some of his available Offensive Bo -nus to parry a foe when attacked. His DB is increased by an equal amount and counts against all melee at -tacks from that foe for the round. If he has no OB left, because it was already spent on an attack or parrying others, then he may not parry. No penalties apply to the parry DB directly, but injury penalties, pace, and other penalties will reduce the available Offensive Bo -nus and therefore limit the amount of parrying that is possible.

If the combatant who is parrying is making multiple attacks that round, his OB for all his attacks is reduced by the same amount, although it is only added to the DB once.

As  long  as  the  last Action  Point  a  combatant  spent on actions was on a melee action, he may parry any foe  who  attacks  him  in  melee.  (Spending  an Action Point on movement does not interrupt melee or pre -vent parrying.) If the attacker is to his rear or flank the OB is penalized by the positional modifier (Table 9-5) before any amount of OB is diverted to DB, although that penalty may be offset by the Combat Expertise: Reverse Strike skill.

- Example: Niles is training several young monks and one of them is behind him. Niles' unarmed OB is +90, of which he will parry with 50. Normally, this would be completely eliminated due to the -70 penalty for attacks (and parry) to the rear, but Niles has +50 Reverse Strike skill. The penalty is reduced to -20, so 30 of his parry will be applied against the young monk's attack.

A combatant may attempt to parry more than one foe, reducing the OB by the desired amount against each foe. An Absolute maneuver roll is required for each foe to be parried after the first (using the combatant's Combat Training skill), and with a Success or higher the foe may be parried (otherwise no effect). A maneu -ver roll is allowed for each additional foe even if an earlier such roll was failed. If a combatant uses all of his OB for parrying, so that his OB is zero by the time his attack would resolve, no attack is made.

Example: Anika is fighting a wolf with two attacks (bite and claw). Anika's OB is +100 with her falchion. She chooses to parry the wolf with 30. As a result, her OB is reduced to +70, but her DB increases by 30 against both attacks. The goblin riding the wolf is also attacking with a spear. If Anika succeeds in an Absolute maneuver with her Blades skill, she could decide to parry the goblin with +20, but that would reduce her OB to +50. Decisions, decisions.

In  some  situations,  it  can  be  very  difficult  to  parry, such as an unarmed combatant parrying an opponent with a weapon. If parrying is restricted, only 1 point of DB is added for every 2 points of OB spent (round up). All other parry rules apply as normal. If multiple sit -uations apply to make parrying exceptionally difficult the GM may rule that parrying cannot be applied at all. Restricted parrying includes the following situations:

-  An  unarmed  combatant  parrying  against  someone with a weapon, unless the unarmed combatant has an item or armor with which to parry (e.g., brac -ers, small shield, or a large metal mug).
-  A  combatant  fighting  an  invisible  foe,  because  he cannot see blows coming, so he can only guess at where to parry to cover vital areas.
-  A  combatant  fighting  an  incorporeal  foe  because blocking  is  ineffective  and  he  can  only  rely  on motion to avoid getting hit.
-  GM discretion: The Gamemaster may rule additional situations that restrict one's ability to parry (e.g., a small halfling with a dagger parrying a gigantic dragon claw attack).

Example: Xavier, having just broken his heirloom sword, is left with nothing but his own hands and his skill at Martial Arts Strikes when he is set upon by a fearsome war mattock-wielding ogre! Because he has nothing with which to parry, Xavier is restricted in his parrying. He decides to parry 80, which gives him +40 DB instead of the normal +80. If he had been more thoughtful, he might have held onto the hilt of his broken sword; it would have been enough to use for more effective parrying.

##### Shields

Like armor, the use of shields is varied, from small target  shields  to  large  wall  shields  weighing  20  lbs. Larger shields can protect the most but are bulky and heavy. Very skilled combatants can use even smaller shields  to  great  effect,  especially  when  confronted with a single foe.

A  shield  may  be  used  against  one  attack  which  the combatant  is  aware  of  and  facing  in  his  front  arc. Larger shields may be used against more than one at -tack, up to a maximum number of attacks based on the shield type as shown in Table 9-6. For each attack be -yond the first, a maneuver roll must be made using the combatant's Shield skill. On a Success or higher the DB may be applied, otherwise it is not. A failed roll still counts against the maximum number of attacks. Shield DB may be applied against melee, missile, and directed spell attacks.

Additionally,  a  combatant  may  add  his  Shield  skill ranks to his DB, for a maximum of +50 DB due to shield (including the base shield DB). This bonus ap -plies against the same attacks as the base shield DB. This passive blocking may not be combined with pas -sive dodging, as using the shield involves its own type of footwork as is represented by the Shield skill.

By spending actions, a shield may be used even more effectively  to  block  melee  or  ranged  attacks.  Partial blocking  requires  concentration  and  adds  half  the combatant's  Shield  skill  to  their  DB.  Full  blocking takes  4 Action  Points  and  adds  the  combatant's  full Shield skill to their DB. The bonuses for partial and full blocking are reduced by any injury penalties the character has sustained, and by any pace penalty if the character is moving. As above, a Shield maneuver roll is required for each attack after the first. Only one type of blocking (partial, full, or passive) may be used per round.

A shield used to attack (a shield bash) does not pro -vide any DB whatsoever for the round.

Example: Anika has a full shield, 15 ranks of Shield skill, and a bonus of +78. She uses her shield against the spear of a goblin and the bite of the wolf he is riding upon, as well as an arrow fired by a goblin archer. She intends to attack, so she chooses to only benefit from passive blocking. Anika's DB increases by 25 + 15 = 40. She gains this benefit for the first attack automatically, but must succeed in a Shield absolute maneuver for each of the other attacks to use the shield against them.

Example: Later, Anika is facing three goblin archers. She chooses a full block as she is advancing on their position, costing her 4 AP but hopefully keeping her alive long enough to attack them next round. Her bonus is 25 + 78 = +103, but, as before, she must succeed in a Shield absolute maneuver to defend against the second and third arrows. Nevertheless, she is grateful she left her little target shield at home and brought the full shield!

Weapons and Items as 'Shields'

Weapons, or other suitably robust items, can be used for passive defense. A combatant can use a sword to attack and parry, and a stool in the off-hand as addi -tional  defense.  If  not  used  to  attack  or  parry,  items give a +5 DB vs. one melee attack. Such items cannot be used with Shield skill for passive, partial, or full blocking. Waving a dagger around will not protect you from incoming arrows! It is best to find cover, move evasively, or find a shield.

| Table 9-6: Shields   | Table 9-6: Shields   | Table 9-6: Shields   |

| Type                 | DB                   | MaxAttacks           |

#### 9.7. Special Maneuvers

##### Called Shots

Sometimes  a  combatant  may  wish  to  attack  a  spe -cific  location  on  the  body,  such  as  the  head.  The five locations  on  the  critical  tables  are  head  (in -cluding neck), arms, chest, abdomen (including groin),  and  legs,  and  limbs  each  have  a  right  and a left. Making a called shot incurs a penalty due to the difficulty of hitting the specific location.

Against  same-sized  humanoids,  a  called  shot  usually incurs a penalty of -25 to the attack roll. The GM may decide  in  some  circumstances  to  impose  a  greater  or lesser penalty (from -50 to -10). For example, a human melee attacking a giant's right leg with a dagger may only be a -10, while attacking his head may be -50.

Called shots are most useful when the targeted area is less armored than the remainder of the body. If the tar -geted area is armored differently from the torso, treat the attack as being against AT 1 for no armor, AT 3 for light armor, AT 5 for medium armor, and AT 9 for heavy armor.

If  the  attack  is  successful,  then  the  attack  has  hit  the specified  location.  If  a  critical  is  inflicted,  make  the critical roll as normal, but if the rolled result indicates a different location, keep checking lesser results on that column until you reach one that affects the called body area, and resolve using that result. If there is no such lesser row, then the strike was on target but mostly inef -fective; use the result on the column for an 01 result and modify the text to fit. The Groin &amp; Abdomen result on a 66 cannot be obtained by this shift (it may still be used if rolled naturally); use the 26-35 result instead.

##### Disarming

A disarming attack seeks to force an opponent to drop his  weapon,  or  even  take  it  from  him.  Disarming  at -tempts are resolved as a conflicting maneuver, with the disarmer rolling as if it were a normal attack (including any penalty from the target parrying the attacker), with additional  penalties  as  indicated  on  Table  9-7a.  The defending foe makes a defense roll (which does not re -quire an action), as if it were an attack roll (subtracting any parry used), with any amount over 100 used as an additional penalty to the attacker's disarm roll or any amount under 100 applied as a bonus. The result is in -dicated on Table 9-7a.

Learning techniques to disarm can help in the disarm -ing attempt. Combatants can use the Combat Expertise: Disarming skill bonus to reduce the disarming penalties (except for the foe's defense roll), to a minimum pen -alty of 0.

Table 9-7a: Disarm Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Your attempt to disarm your foe is laughable. Not only do you fail to come close to disarming him, but you immediately fum -ble your weapon.

1 - 75 Failure

Sigh. Some days it just seems like the world is out to get you. You miss your opportunity. You fail to disarm. You fail to attack. You just fail.  You're a failure.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Weird… it seems your foe is trying to disarm you, perhaps in -advertently, at the same time. If you fail this maneuver, your foe has disarmed you. If you succeed, you still manage to disarm your foe, but drop your weapon as well.

76 - 100 Partial Success

You can't partially disarm someone! Instead treat the disarm as a normal attack using this roll, but using all normal modifiers (and parry).

101 - 175 Success

You  successfully  disarm  your  foe!  The  weapon  falls  to  the ground (and must make a breakage check), but is within melee range.

176 + Absolute Success

You make disarming look  easy  as  your  foe  gawks  at  you  as you expertly remove him from his weapon. You may choose between taking the weapon for yourself or throw it up to 10' in a direction of your choice.

Modifiers

- -50 Unarmed/grapple/crush attack
- -75 Blade attack
- -100 Piercing attack
- -100 Ranged attack*
- -25 Disarming a 2-H weapon*
* cumulative with other penalties

The  penalties  for  disarming  a  2-H  weapon,  the  foe's defense roll, and using a ranged weapon are cumulative with all other penalties.

Disarming  cannot  be  used  against  natural  attacks;  at best one can make a called shot on that body part and hope to incapacitate or sever the attacking limb.

Example: The angry peasant rushes at Meretor with a wooden club and misinformed accusations. Embarrassed but with no desire to harm the peasant, Meretor attempts to disarm him instead. Meretor is armed with a broadsword (-75 for disarming). His melee skill is +87 and his Disarm skill is +40 (reducing the penalty to -35). He puts faith in his abilities and elects not to parry, so his total is +52. He rolls 41. The peasant has +20 melee skill and rolls a 30. Since the peasant's roll has fallen under 100, the amount below 100 (50) is added to Meretor's roll for a total of 143. The peasant' s club tumbles to the ground.

##### Firing into Melee

There is nothing preventing a combatant from firing or throwing a weapon into melee, whether to hit a foe amongst allies or pick out a specific foe in a battle. Based on the position of the attacker,  defender,  and other combatants the defender may gain cover from the other combatants.

Example: Two characters are in melee. An archer is trying to shoot past his ally to hit an enemy. The GM decides that the target has partial hard cover based on the positions of the three combatants, and this gives the target +40 DB for cover.

If a ranged attack misses its intended target then the attack may randomly hit one of the combatants that provided cover. In this case, make a second attack roll at +0 skill OB against the secondary target. The new target (select randomly if more than one) does not gain the benefit of any cover modifiers from other combat -ants. Fumbles are ignored on the second attack roll.

##### Katas

Most often,  a  combatant  is  wielding  a  single  weap -on  and  attacking  a  single  opponent.  However,  on occasion, a combatant may be using multiple attacks together (multiple weapons or natural attacks). These simultaneous attacks are often learned by practicing combinations of moves that allow the motions of the attacks  to  flow  together,  each  alongside  or  into  the next, referred to as katas. These moves are performed either simultaneously or in rapid succession, allowing multiple attacks to be resolved.

To  execute  multiple  attacks,  the  use  of  each  attack must be justified with respect to a given limb, with no limb used as the basis for more than one attack. For example,  a  combatant  wielding  two  weapons,  with one in each hand, may strike once with each of them. A  combatant  could  also  make  a  martial  arts  sweep with a leg or a strike with the head (i.e., a head butt or horns), but cannot use either to make a dagger attack unless  they  have  somehow  mounted  blades  on  their boot and helmet, which would be awkward enough to add a significant penalty to OB.

A weapon wielded in a combatant's off-hand suffers a -20 penalty (unless they have the Ambidextrous talent) and uses the same skill as that weapon in their primary hand. Natural, unarmed attacks, and shield attacks do not suffer any penalty for use of the off-hand.

When  making  two  simultaneous  attacks,  there  is  a penalty of -75 to each attack. For each attack beyond two, this penalty increases by  -25, as shown in Table 9-7b. Furthermore, there is a penalty of -20 for each opponent beyond the first, also applied to all attacks. The penalties (including the multiple opponent penal -ty) can be offset by the combatant's Combat Expertise: Multiple Attacks skill.

The  penalties  for  katas  are  also  offset  by  modifiers for light weapons, but note that the total modifier can never result in a net bonus to the attack, only in can -celling out the penalties. A light weapon is a dagger, unarmed  attack,  natural  weapon  (e.g.,  claws,  bite), or any weapon with a -1 size adjustment (e.g., epee, machete, hand axe). If the combatant is making more than two attacks, the bonus for a light off-hand weap -on only applies once, and only if all attacks beyond the first are qualified. For example, a combatant attacking with  a  sword,  dagger,  and  a  kick  would  receive  the +20 bonus, but a combatant striking with two swords and a kick would not.

Note that  while  katas  allow  multiple  attacks  as  part of a single attack action, a combatant may also make multiple attacks simply by performing multiple attack actions, either by using fewer Action Points for each attack or if they have extra Action Points (e.g., due to a Haste effect). The penalties on table 9-7b apply only to attacks made as part of the same attack action.

Example: Kulahren wants to attack one foe with his dagger and another with his rapier. Two attacks are -75 each, and attacking two foes gives an additional -20. This -95 is reduced by Kulahren's Multiple Attack skill of +59 (including a +20 bonus because his off-hand weapon is a dagger) resulting in a -95 + 59 = -36 to both attacks. If he wanted to attack only one foe with both weapons they would each have a penalty of -75 + 59 =  -16 instead.

##### Mounted Combat

Being mounted provides an enormous tactical advantage. Mounted combatants benefit from the animal's speed and mass when charging, as well as a higher ground bonus when  they  are  fighting  similarly-sized  opponents  on foot. Charging attacks made by mounted opponents are treated as the size of the mount plus any increases due to charging speed (based on the BMR of the mount). The mount  and  rider  are  considered  separate  combatants, with separate initiatives  and  actions.  Fumbles  made  in mounted combat should be rolled on the 'Mounted Com -bat' column.

However, riders attacking from a moving mount are sub -ject  to  a  Pace  Penalty  based  on  the  pace  of  the  mount (-100  for  Sprint,  -125  for  Dash).  These  penalties  can be reduced with the Battle Expertise: Mounted Combat skill.

Controlling a mount is assumed to be a negligible activ -ity under normal circumstances; however, the GM may require  a  Riding  maneuver  for  unusual  maneuvers  or situations. Riders with zero riding skill ranks are the ex -ception to this rule, and attempts to make attacks from a moving mount should require a medium riding maneuver at the normal -25 no skill penalty plus mount pace each round an attack is declared from a moving mount, with failure resulting in the rider falling off.

Note that mounts not trained for combat will very likely panic and flee when fighting breaks out. Rules for mount morale and fear are covered in Section 14.3.

##### Protecting Others

Sometimes  a  combatant  may  want  to  parry  or  use  a shield  to  protect  an  ally.  He  can  do  so  by  sacrificing some offensive capability to impose himself between the other  combatants. The  protector  must  be  within  melee range of both of the combatants, and gets a penalty to his OB based on his position as indicated on Table 9-7c. The  penalties  can  be  offset  by  the  combatant's  Battle Expertise: Protect skill. The protector may designate any part of his parry or shield DB as protecting the defended combatant  instead  of  himself.  The  protector  may  wait until the attack is declared before deciding to do so.

Example: Anika and Talen are side by side facing a massive ogre with a +150 OB. They both allocate 80 to parry, which is probably not enough to stop the ogre's blow. However, as the ogre begins to swing his huge axe at Talen, Anika decides she will protect her ally. She has +25 in the Protect skill, offsetting half the penalty of -50. Thus, Anika takes a -25 to her OB (lowering her parry to +55) and parries the remainder on behalf of Talen. Talen now has a DB of 135 (80 from his own parry + 55 from Anika). Talen now has a decent chance to survive, but Anika has left herself open to any attacks directed toward her.

##### Slaying Attacks

Some attacks (often magical) are exceptionally dan -gerous  and  carry  a  higher chance  of severe injury. Similarly,  some  creatures may  be  particularly  vul -nerable to a type of attack (e.g., fire attacks vs.  an ice  elemental).  These  are referred  to  as  Slaying  attacks  and  are  one  of  the

<!-- image -->

| Table 9-7d: Type   |   Slaying Crit Bonus |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| I                  |                   +5 |
| II                 |                  +10 |
| III                |                  +15 |
| IV                 |                  +20 |
| V                  |                  +25 |

few effects that give a direct bonus to the critical roll as indicated in Table 9-7d. A Slaying weapon or effect is given a Slaying Type from I - V. Creatures who are vulnerable will state that specific attacks are treated as Slaying and also give the type.

Example: A broadsword +5 of orc Slaying II will get +10 to any critical rolls against orcs.

Example: A fire elemental takes Slaying II from wa -ter attacks, thus all water based attacks get +10 to the critical roll.

##### Subdual

Combatants  may  attempt  non-lethal  attacks  that  are intended to knock out or otherwise subdue a foe with -out killing him. Subdual attacks inflict more non-le -thal injuries such as stuns and fatigue, although there is still a risk of seriously injuring or killing the foe.

Some weapons are more suitable for use in subduing than others. A subdual attack is treated like a normal attack, except that the modifiers in Table 9-7e apply based  on  the  type  of  weapon  or  attack  used.  Some weapons  may  be  specifically  designed  with  hooks, pincers or wrapping elements to make them more suit -ed to use in subdual than is described here. Most such specialty  weapons  inflict  a  grapple  critical  (which subdues in its own way), but modifications to standard weapons (such as adding a blunt hook to the back of a pole axe) might make them suited to lesser penalties than are given in the table at the discretion of the GM. Learning to use more precise blows, combined with knowledge of target anatomy can help render an op -ponent immobile or unconscious. The penalties can be offset by the combatant's Combat Expertise: Subdual skill.

Most  humanoids  are  assumed  to  share  a  common enough anatomy that the unfamiliar anatomy penalty would not apply. For other known races and creatures, the Subdual skill is assumed to include subdual tech -niques,  or  at  least  a  rough  knowledge  of  vulnerable points,  so  the  penalty  applies  but  may  be  canceled out  using  Subdual  skill.  However,  for  completely unknown races or creatures, the unfamiliar anatomy penalty cannot be offset by the Subdual skill.

Subdual  attacks  do  half  concussion  hit  damage  and use  the  Subdual  critical  table  instead  of  the  normal critical type, with a maximum severity of E.

Example: The ever-talented Karn has a Subdual skill bonus of +100. In melee combat, he could make a subdual attack with any type of weapon without penalty. However, Karn's favorite mode of attack is from afar. He will often try to subdue using a short bow, with which he gets a -50 to all subdual attacks. (-100 for piercing, -50 for ranged, total penalty of -150 +100 bonus for a final penalty of -50.)

##### Touch Attacks

While there are very few offensive spells with a range of 'touch,' there are a couple of fairly common situ -ations in which a caster will wish to touch a target to deliver a spell in a combat situation. The first case is when the caster wishes to touch a target in order to gain the -15 RR modifier for a range of 'Touch' (see Spell  Law ,  Table  4-5). The  second  case  is  when  the caster  wishes  to  make  contact  with  an  ally  in  order to deliver a touch-ranged Utility spell. Any unarmed combat skill can be used to attempt to deliver a spell touch  to  a  target  engaged  in  melee,  with  any  result of 1 hit or more indicating successful delivery of the spell by contact. The caster can choose to only attempt to 'tag' the target to deliver the spell, in which case no actual damage is done, but that must be declared before the attack is rolled. While a friendly target will likely not actively defend (parry, apply a shield, etc.) against the caster's attempted touch, it is still difficult to make solid contact with an active combatant, who is moving unpredictably in an environment where the caster must also look to his own safety, so DB due to Quickness, magical armor, applicable spells, etc. still applies. A  foe  who  has  declared  parry  on  the  caster gets full benefit of the parry to their DB for this type of attack.

#### 9.8. Criticals &amp; Injuries

An injury is all of the hits inflicted as well as criticals delivered as the result of an attack, failed maneuver, or  spell.  Hits  represent  light  injuries  (bruises,  cuts), general pain, minor blood loss, and the will to keep fighting. Criticals represent types of damage causing more  serious  wounds  that  can  include  stun,  broken and severed limbs, and major blood loss.

There are a variety of critical tables representing dif -ferent  types  of  damage  (e.g.,  Slash,  Puncture,  Heat, etc.),  each  with  5  levels  of  severity  from A  to  E. A criticals are the least severe and usually result in minor damage, with an incapacitating injury or death only occurring in very rare cases (i.e., a roll of 100). E criti -cals tend to be moderate to severe, with a good chance of death or incapacitation, although minor blows can result. Each critical result will give a description and a series of numbers and symbols. (e.g., 'Foe reels from the blow. +5 hits; stunned 1 round').

Criticals are resolved with a straight d100 (non-openended)  roll,  usually  without  modifiers.  Slaying  at -tacks, Ambush attacks, exceptional attacks over 175, and possibly  magical  effects  can  modify  the  critical roll, but these tend to be rare.

Although the critical tables have a maximum severity of E, the attack tables may indicate results as severe as J. Criticals higher than an E do an E critical plus a secondary critical as shown in Table 9-8a. Depending on the type of attack the type of the secondary critical (e.g., Slash, Krush, etc.) may not be the same. If the at -tack table lists multiple types of criticals, they are used in  the  order  listed.  If  multiple  criticals  are  delivered against a target for any reason, all criticals always use the same roll and modifiers, and consequently will hit the same target location (so a flaming sword will cut and burn the target's arm, rather than cutting his arm and burning his foot).

The severity of a critical can also be increased or de -creased due to size differences or other factors. If a critical is reduced below an A severity, find the next lower result that affects the same area of the body on the A column and apply it. If the critical is reduced more than 1 below an A, move down again to the next lower result for each step less than A. If there is no lower result for that area then use the lowest (01 roll) critical result and change the description as necessary.

Example: An A Krush critical is scored and the roll is 70, but the severity is reduced due to use of a small weapon against a medium target. A result of 67-75 is a Leg hit, so the next lower Leg result (for 36-45) is used instead: 'Weak delivery, but great timing. Foe caught off balance.'

Example: Another A Krush critical is rolled in the same circumstance, with a result of 8, another Leg shot. There is no lesser Leg result, so the result of 1 is used instead. Since it indicates 'Blow barely grazes foe's ear,' the GM tells the player 'the blow barely grazes your knee' instead.

When an area effect causes criticals to  multiple  tar -gets, the result for each target should be rolled sepa - rately, so it is possible for a Fire Ball to burn one  target's  arm  and another  target's foot. The  GM  may  choose to  roll  a  single  time for  a  large  group,  or for sections of a large group,  to save  time.

(I.e.,  if  boiling  water  pours  over  a  hundred  soldiers inflicting a B Heat critical on each of them, the GM may choose to roll one critical for all 100, or perhaps five groups of 20 to keep some variation.)

##### Interpreting Criticals

Critical results assume a humanoid opponent, which can easily be adjusted for most beings. Across all crit -ical tables and severities, for a given roll, the location is always the same (e.g., a roll of 56-65 is always an arm hit). In the case more guidance is needed, use the rough rules below.

- Location : Criticals occur in one of 5 locations: arm, leg,  head,  chest,  and  abdomen  (lower  abdomen and groin). It is often necessary to know on which side of the body the hit has been scored (partic -ularly  with  arm  and  leg  hits).  If  the  unmodified attack roll is odd, the hit has been on the foe's left side, while if the unmodified attack roll is even, the hit has been on his right side.
- Death :  Any  critical  that  specifies  death  should  be considered as causing death, regardless of the tar -get. For example, if a skeleton who does not have a brain receives a critical result that says 'brain is destroyed,' the skeleton's head is destroyed and it is 'dead' anyway. Any specific exceptions to this rule will be noted in the creature's description in Creature Law .
- Multiples of the same limb pair : If the foe has mul -tiple sets of arms or legs, determine the side using the left-right rule, then randomly determine which limb was hit.
- Non-humanoids :  If  the  foe  is  non-humanoid  then shift the location to the most analogous location on the foe. A quadruped's hind legs would be leg locations while the front legs would be arm loca -tions. An octopus' tentacles would be the leg and arm locations (determine left-right then random -ize).
- No  such  location :  Snakes,  amoebas,  and  certain other creatures might not have a specific location that matches the given critical location. In these cases, change the text of the critical to affect the torso or other appropriate part, while keeping the actual results of the critical.
- Tail :  Tails  are  sensitive  areas,  being  an  extension of the spine, so the tail is considered part of the abdomen. If it is plausible that the tail has been hit in combat (e.g., frontal attack in a narrow corridor is  not),  use odd/even to determine abdomen/tail. For a 66 result, randomly determine if it is the ab -domen or tail.
- Wings : For birds and other creatures with no arms, wings will equate to arms. However, if the foe has arms and wings, use the left-right rule then ran -domly determine if it is an arm or a wing.

Criticals  can  cause  a  variety  of  effects  from  fatigue to  bleeding  to  long-term  damage  or  death.  The  text of  a  critical  will  describe  the  hit,  and  sometimes  a specific effect such as dropping an item. All types of standard critical results are described below, although some critical results may additionally describe a more unique effect.

##### Bleeding

Bleeding  too  serious  to  stop  on  its  own  will  cause additional  hits  every  round  until  death  or  until  it  is stopped  through  first  aid  or  magic.  Even  a  wound bleeding at 1 hit/round will cause death within min -utes.  Minor  bleeding  wounds  that  clot  on  their  own are part of generic hit damage taken. Bleeding is sub -tracted from hits at the end of every round (during the upkeep phase).

##### Breakage

Some  criticals  will  trigger  a  breakage  roll  (Section 6.1) in the location hit, sometimes at a penalty. This could be armor, a shield, or an item carried at that lo -cation. If the GM decides there are multiple options for  breakage,  randomly  determine  which  one  of  the possible items in that area requires a breakage roll.

If the critical indicates an item is dropped it must make an immediate breakage roll. In addition to determining if the item has been damaged or broken, the ones die of the breakage roll is how far away the item has land -ed,  in  feet.  The  GM  can  overrule  this  if  it  does  not make sense (e.g., an anvil will always land near your feet, but a ball may end up far away).

##### Fatigue

Fatigue can represent anything from getting the wind knocked out of you to getting out-maneuvered (there -by  requiring  additional  energy  with  which  to  attack or defend). Fatigue penalties are effective immediately and can be lowered by normal means (e.g., rest, Abso -lute Success on an Endurance roll, spells, etc.).

Keep in mind that fatigue results in excess of -50 total should be converted into an injury, which takes effect immediately. The specifics of the fatigue injury should be  determined  by  the  GM,  based  on  the  critical  or fumble that caused the penalty to increase past -50.

##### Grapple

Grapples  are  often  due  to  unarmed  attacks  such  as wrestling, but can also occur from nets, bolas, or other entangling attacks. Grapple results are given as a per -centage representing how effectively the defender has been grabbed, held, or entangled. The grapple % is a penalty to all actions for the defender until he breaks free.  Grappling  is  cumulative,  so  a  30%  grapple  re -sult followed by a 10% grapple results in the defender grappled for 40% and making actions at -40.

The  defender  can  attempt  to  break  or  slip  free  of  a grapple using the rules for contested Feats of Strength (Section  5.2)  using  his  Wrestling,  Contortions,  or other  appropriate  grappling  skill,  with  the  defender subject to the full grapple penalty. If the grappler is an object such as a net rather than a combatant, treat the escape attempt as a Medium maneuver, otherwise use the opponent's weight to determine the difficulty. Any attempt to break free from a grapple is a 2-4 AP action (4 AP at -0, 3 AP at -25, or 2 AP at -50). If grappled by  multiple  attackers,  rolls  must  be  made  to  escape from each one, although the total penalty applies to all rolls, and no additional AP are required (a single action permits a roll against each attacker). The grap -ple is automatically broken if the attacker is stunned, incapacitated, or decides to release the defender.

As with other conflicting maneuvers, the amount the attacker rolls over 100 is subtracted from the target's roll to escape and the result resolved as a Percentage Maneuver. The grapple is reduced by the Percentage Maneuver result.

Example: Aldrik has chased a cultist into a cave, where he is attacked by an entangling vine and the cultist himself. The vine achieves a 10% grapple and the cultist 20%. Aldrik spends the full round (4 AP) attempting to break free. Aldrik is a passable wrestler with a +43 Wrestling skill. Since the vine is a plant, the gamemaster considers it a Medium maneuver to escape (+0). The vine has a grappling OB of +30 and rolls 35 for a total of 65, adding 100 - 65 = 35 to Aldrik's roll of 63 and his skill for a total of 141, minus the total grapple amount of 30. The final result of 111 gives a result of 100 on the percentage maneuver table, so he is free of the plant.

At the same time, Aldrik is trying to break free from the cultist. Since they weigh approximately the same amount, each is trying to control 100% of their own weight, resulting in a Very Hard (-20) maneuver for both combatants. The cultist rolls an 88 with a skill of 60, minus 20, subtracting 28 from Aldrik' s new roll. Aldrik' s roll to break free is a roll of 47 +

43 skill -20 for the Very Hard maneuver -28 for his foe' s roll -30 for the grapple amounts, for a total of 12. This yields a result of 10 on the percentage maneuver table, reducing the cultist' s grip from a 20% grapple to just 10%, but Aldrik is not free yet.

Until the grapple is broken, the attacker and defender are bound together, and neither can move away with -out a contested Feat of Strength (Section 5.2) based on Weight-Training skill to move their foe. This Feat is part of their movement action and does not require any additional expenditure of AP, but also will not break the  grapple;  if  successful,  the  foe  is  dragged  along, unless the attacker chooses to let go.

Example: Anika, a 210 lbs warrior from the snowy north, is grappled by a 93 lbs hobgoblin, who has somehow managed to achieve  a 40% grapple. She has better things to do and tries to walk away. The hobgoblin is 44% of her weight, making it a Medium maneuver for her, while she is 225% of the hobgoblin, putting him at an Absurd (-70) maneuver. The hobgoblin rolls 67 plus his skill of 50, minus 70 for a total of 47, adding 53 to Anika' s roll. Wrestling isn't her strongest suit, but she has a +47 skill and rolls a 61, plus +0 for a Medium maneuver and +53 from the hobgoblin's roll, minus 40 for the grapple, for a total of 121, which yields a 100 result on the percentage maneuver table. The hobgoblin isn't even slowing her down.

##### Hits

Hits  are  most  often  inflicted  from  the Attack  Table, however critical  effects  can  also  cause  hits. A  com -batant is knocked unconscious when he drops to 0 or fewer hits, but he takes penalties to all actions once more than 25% of total hits are lost, as shown in Table 9-8b.  Death  occurs  when  a  character  has  taken  hits beyond zero that exceed that character's Body Devel -opment skill bonus. (Thus, a character with a 50 bonus in Body Development skill dies at -51 hits.)

| Table 9-8b: Hit Loss Hits Lost   |   Penalties Penalty |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| 0 - 25%                          |                   0 |
| 26 - 50%                         |                 -10 |
| 51 - 75%                         |                 -20 |
| 76% +                            |                 -30 |

##### Penalties

Many  injuries  result  in  a  penalty,  which  is  applied to  absolute  and  percentage  maneuvers,  spellcast -ing, attacks, and full or partial blocking or dodging. Penalties represent the loss of functionality (whereas pain is represented by hit loss and its corresponding penalties). Penalties from all injuries stack, although if the affected area has nothing to do at all with the ma -neuver then the penalty should not apply at all. If the affected area is not being directly used, but does have some role, then half the penalty may be appropriate. When in doubt apply the full sum of all penalties. All injury penalties last until the injury is healed, although the penalty diminishes over time (Section 13.1).

Example: Flinky's -10 for a broken finger does not apply to jumping over the pit, and her -20 from broken toes does not apply to picking a lock on the door further down the hall. Trying to pull the heavy, somewhat stuck door open would face the full -30 penalty for both.

The sum of a character's penalties generally reflects how broken he is. Penalties  of  -50  or  more  mean  a character is  having serious problems, and should be role-played that way. As penalties approach -100 char -acters are approaching incapacitation.

Once penalties reach -100, the character is in serious distress. Any action that requires effort (movement, at -tacks, spell casting or any maneuvers requiring phys -ical effort) will provoke a fatigue check for the round. This will continue until penalties have been reduced to a lower severity than -100. You need to sit down and rest, and any action will tend to make things worse.

At  total  penalties  of  -200  or  more,  the  character  is dying from his collective injuries, and must make a fatigue check every round, even if lying still. This will continue until total penalties are reduced below -200. Once penalties reach or exceed -300, the character will die on the next upkeep phase due to systemic shock.

##### Staggered

Staggered means that the combatant has been knocked off balance. A staggered result immediately loses 1 Ac -tion Point, either this round if the target has any left, or  the  beginning  of  the  following  round. A  staggered combatant  may  still  parry,  as  long  as  the  last Action Point he spent was on a melee action, but his OB (and consequently his Parry) may be reduced if fewer Action Points are available to be spent on his attack action. Any in-progress action may be continued upon the combat -ant's next opportunity to expend an Action Point.

Example: Cael is firing his bow, starting in the first Action Phase. After spending his second AP in the second Action Phase, he is struck by a thrown rock and Staggered. He loses his AP in the third Action Phase, but is able to complete firing his bow in the fourth Action Phase, having expended a total of three AP.

Example: Lexxa begins her round with a Perception check (2 AP) and spots a foe hiding in the bushes. On the third Action Phase she begins a melee attack, but is struck from behind and Staggered. She loses her fourth AP and is unable to complete the attack. If she had only spent one AP on Perception and started her attack in the second Action Phase, she would have been able to resolve her attack at the very end of the round, at a penalty of -50 for a 2 AP melee attack.

##### Prone

Prone means the target has been thrown flat to the floor and is subject to the usual modifiers to action for prone position, and he must take a 2 Action Point action to stand up again (this may be reduced to 1 AP with a suc -cessful Acrobatics maneuver).

##### Knocked Back

Being knocked back will move the character a distance in feet in a given direction, as indicated by the critical result.  Depending  on  the  terrain  the  combatant  may suffer additional effects. Being knocked over an edge or into a stairwell/steep slope may provoke a fall, being knocked  into  water  or  fire  may  provoke  skill  checks or  criticals.  Being  knocked  into  an  object  may  inflict damage on the person and/or a breakage check on the object crashed into (depending on their relative sturdi -ness). The GM should use his discretion, but even the worst case scenario of being thrown directly into a solid wall or a rack of spears should not inflict a critical of a higher severity level than the one that provoked the knockback (use an A if in doubt).

Unless the target is knocked unconscious and knocked back, the GM should allow the knocked back target a maneuver roll (using either the appropriate movement skill or Acrobatics) to attempt to catch himself at a dif -ficulty determined by the GM based on the situation.

If  the  'object' the combatant is knocked back into is another aware entity, both the combatant and the tar -get may end up harmed in the collision. If the knocked back combatant is coming from the front of the second character,  assume  the  target  sees  him  coming;  if  he comes from the flank or behind, have the target make a Perception maneuver to see the knocked back charac -ter coming at him (difficulty based on how chaotic the situation  is).  The  GM  should  determine  the  difficulty of getting out of the way based on the specifics of the situation  and  make  a  maneuver  using  Acrobatics  or the appropriate Movement skill to get out of the way. Location is fuzzy enough within 'combat radius' that this  maneuver  should  be  considered  an  instantaneous action.  If  they  fail  to  move  out  of  the  way,  they  are knocked prone.

##### Stun

A  stun  means  the  combatant  has  been  knocked  hard enough to disorient and put him in a vulnerable state. The  effect  is  a  temporary  penalty  each  round,  either -25, -50, or -75, as indicated in the critical, representing different amounts of disorientation:

-  [-25]: A minor disorientation where the combatant is dizzy and unstable.
-  [-50]: The combatant has been hit seriously enough to disrupt his senses, and he is struggling to control his body.
-  [-75]: Suffering from a serious blow, the combatant is having a hard time remaining standing and nearly at his foe's mercy.

All stun results are cumulative, with the total rounds of Stun[-25]  adding  together,  Stun[-50]  adding  together, and  so  on.  One  round  of  stun  effect  wears  off  at  the end of the round, from the worst effect to the least (-75 rounds wear off first, then -50, then -25).

- Example: A few rounds into a battle, Taor has 2 rounds of Stun[-50] and 1 round of Stun[-25]. Unfortunately he then gets hit from behind, resulting in one round of Stun[-75] and 1 round of Stun[-25]. He now will be at -75 for 1 round, then -50 for two rounds, then -25 for 2 rounds. Poor Taor!

Stunned characters are in a state of mental confusion due to a blow, and players should be encouraged to roleplay this state. Any maneuvers related to memories of events that happened during a stunned round should be made at -50. This is true even years later; the character simply lacks a clear memory of those events.

- Example: During the fight, Elsarde was stunned when the priest shouted a threat at the group of PCs attacking the temple. After the fight, Elsarde asks the GM what the priest was shouting. The GM has her make a Perception maneuver to see if she was paying attention to such details, which is at -50 because she was stunned. Alas, she fails: 'I dunno Victor, that whole middle of the fight is kind of hazy.'

Some creatures may be immune to stun (as noted in the creature  description),  however  they  are  generally  not immune to the knocking around that comes with a good stun. Instead, the target suffers a flat -25 for the remain -der of the round (regardless of the severity of stun), or the  following  round  if  he  has  no Action  Points  left  to spend. The penalty does not stack with additional stuns, it can only be a -25 for 1 round.

- Example: Borin attacks a Skeleton as it comes charging at him and rolls a critical that deals Stun[75] for 5 rounds. The Skeleton, being immune to stuns, is knocked off-balance and is at -25 for the rest of the round and will suffer no penalty thereafter.

#### 9.9. Extended Example

Kirax and Thyrzia have just started work as bounty hunters (see their stats in the examples of Chapter 2). They are on the tail of Harshak, a notorious goat rustler. It's the first bounty they're trying to pick up as a team, so it's not exactly the most glamorous, but hopefully it will lead to something bigger. They've tracked Harshak to a camp in the woods, where they see Harshak and his partners Gavart and Caitsley are getting ready to raid a nearby homestead for livestock.

Kirax uses his Survival skill to make an educated guess which route they will take, rolling a 77 plus his skill of 39 for a total of 116, success. Then he and Thyrzia use Stalking to lay an ambush, with one of them on each side of the trail. The goat rustlers fail to notice them during their initial approach, but the gamemaster gives them another chance during the ambush. Stalking is resolved as a conflicting skill. Kirax rolls 45 plus his skill of 43, for a total of 88. This results in a bonus of 12 to the Perception rolls of those attempting to notice him. Thyrzia does better, rolling 80 plus her skill of 29 for 109, which will subtract 9 from those Perception rolls. Gavart, in the lead, rolls 28 plus his skill of 32, and notices neither bounty hunter. Harshak, in the rear, rolls 36 plus his skill of 40; he gets a partial success to notice Kirax but completely fails to notice Thyrzia. Caitsley, in the middle, rolls 77 with her skill of 30; she notices Kirax and thinks there might be someone else in the area.

At this point the gamemaster moves to combat rounds as conflict is imminent. The first round starts with Gavart in striking range of Thyrzia and Caitsley in range of Kirax, with Harshak further back on the trail. Initiative is Thyrzia first with 23, then Caitsley (13), Harshak (10), Kirax (9), and Gavart (3). Thyrzia and Kirax are within 10' of their targets but do not know the outcome of their quarry's perception rolls. On the first phase, they each begin attacks, with Thyrzia moving to Gavart and Kirax moving to Caitsley. Moving at a Creep pace (with no pace penalty), they will reach their foes by the end of the round. At this point, they notice none of their foes have reacted to them, so they have at least achieved surprise, although they do not yet know to what degree.

On the second phase, Kirax and Thyrzia each have the option to resolve a quick attack (2 AP) at -50, hitting before their foes have any chance to react, or they can continue a full attack and hope they have not been spotted. They decide to have faith in their plan and continue the attack. On the third phase, Thyrzia continues her attack against Gavart. Caitsley, who was surprised but not flat-footed, can now act. She draws a broadsword and makes a run for it, moving 15' (a Run pace). She does not take a defensive action (e.g. making an attack so she can parry, or a partial dodge), because the -75 pace penalty would render those actions moot based on her skill bonuses (since her OB is +55 and her Running skill, for dodging, is +40).

Kirax has another choice. Caitsley was in his melee range, due to the reach of his two-handed spear, so he can either continue his full 4 AP attack pursuing at a run (with a -75 pace penalty), or he can take his attack now (at -25 for a 3 AP attack). Either way, it will be a rear attack (+35), but he's lost his chance for a Surprise bonus or to use his Ambush skill; for those, he would have needed to attack in the 2nd phase before she reacted. Kirax decides to attack now. The attack occurs on Caitsley's initiative, but uses Kirax's action point for the third phase. The total modifiers are +60 (his skill) +10 (for a two-handed weapon) +35 (for a rear attack) -25 (for a 3 AP attack), totaling +80. He could reserve part of this bonus for parrying, but with surprised foes, he decides that's unnecessary. His attack roll is 59 for a total of 139. Caitsley is wearing AT3, and this is a Big attack (because the spear is two-handed), so the result is 23 D Puncture. He rolls a 44 for the critical, a thrust to the knee damaging the joint and causing serious bleeding. The effect is bleeding 4 hits per round, a -5 injury penalty, a -10 fatigue penalty, and two rounds of Stun[ -25]. Caitsley stumbles away in serious pain.

Harshak, with a partial success on his perception roll, has an idea something is going on. He spends the third phase making a 1 AP perception roll to fig -ure out exactly what, and easily notices Kirax now that the attack has begun.

Kirax would be next in the initiative, but he already used his action for the phase against Caitsley. Gavart is last, and still flat-footed and oblivious. He'll be able to act next round.

On the fourth phase, Thyrzia resolves her attack against Gavart. She's armed with a light mace and a hand axe. She opts to attack with both. The base penalty for two attacks is -75, but since both weapons are light, it is reduced to -55, and her Multiple Attacks skill of 20 reduces it to -35. (She' s added this up in advance, since it is a tactic she plans to use whenever she has the advantage.) She also has the ambidextrous talent, eliminating any off-hand penalty. With Gavart flat-footed, he has no defen -sive bonus, and she gains a bonus of +35 for a rear attack and +25 for surprise. Her total bonus based on her OB of +39 is +64. She considers making a subduing attack, but that's one too many penalties and she decides against. She rolls a 41 for the first attack for 105, and an 86 on the second for 150. Gavart is in AT3, and her attacks are Small because they are light weapons, so the mace scores a 7AK and the hand axe 16DS. For the Krush critical, she rolls a 55 and adds her Ambush ranks for a total of 59, cracking a bone in his hand for 14 hits, bleeding 1 hit per round, and a -5 injury penalty. The Slashing critical is a 58, modified to 62, hitting Gavart in the elbow for 32 more hits, a -15 penalty, and a round of Stun[-25]. Gavart has taken a total of 69 damage. That's more than he has, so he falls unconscious. If the bleeding is not stopped, he will eventually die.

Caitsley has the next initiative and keeps running. The gamemaster rules the forest is Hard (-10) terrain to move in. Caitsley is pretty spry, and normally a roll might not be needed, but now she has a -5 injury penalty to one leg, a -10 fatigue penalty, and is Stunned[-25]. He rolls to see how she does, rolling 02 for an open-ended down result, followed by an 8. Her Running skill is +40, so the final total is -6, resolved as a percentage maneuver. She stumbles and fails to get anywhere, but manages not to hurt herself any further.

Harshak unslings a spear and starts backing up. Kirax advances on Harshak. With only one action phase left, he can't start an attack, but he can at least close the distance. Gavart gurgles a bit.

At the end of the round, Gavart loses a hit due to bleeding, and Caitsley loses four. Caitsley is still stunned, since she had spent 3 action points before being stunned last round.

In the second round, Thyrzia is first again (16), then Harshak (12) and Kirax are tied (12), and Caitsley is last (1) in part due to -3 from her various penalties.

Thyrzia moves towards Harshak. Rather than closing, she decides to throw her hand axe. Harshak and Kirax both begin attacks against each other. Caitsley swears and tries to get a bandage around her bleeding wound (using direct pressure). Thyrzia's action will be resolved in the third phase, and everyone else in the fourth phase, so the gamemaster skips forward. Thyrzia throws her axe; 32 plus her skill of 38 for a 70. It whizzes by Harshak's head, barely missing him.

In the fourth phase, Thyrzia draws another hand axe, and Kirax and Harshak make simultaneous attacks against each other. Kirax applies 15 OB to his parry, while Harshak makes a reckless all-out attack. Kirax rolls a 95 for 153, while Harshak rolls a 66 for 111. Kirax deals a 26EP and Harshak a 17CP. Kirax's critical is a 97, tearing through Harshak's chest and guaranteeing a slow, painful death (and immediate incapacitation). Harshak rolls a 62, stabbing Kirax in the shoulder for 14 hits, a -10 injury penalty, and bleeding 4 hits per round.

Also in the fourth phase, Caitsley succeeds at a Medicine maneuver to stop her bleeding, but it will take four minutes of treatment to keep from immediately opening up on her. She calls out, "I... surrender?" Kirax, with his own injury, is happy to accept that and let her go. The bounty was on Harshak. It would have paid better if he was alive, but, well, not much to be done about that now.

### 10. Attack Tables

Tables for each type of attack are given on their own page, including typical modifiers and statistics for the attack as well as optional Small and Big versions of the attack table.

For each attack type, the following information is list -ed:

- Criticals : The types of criticals that may be inflicted by the attack, including the letter used to denote the critical type on the attack tables.
- Disarm modifier : The penalty to Disarm attempts, from Table 9-7a in Section 9.7.
- Subdual modifier : The penalty to Subdual attempts, from Table 9-7e in Section 9.7.
- Size :  For  weapons  and  natural  attacks,  the  size  is given as a modifier. A +0 size is an attack of the same size as the attacker (typically Medium). A +1 size is an attack one size larger, e.g., a Medi -um attacker with a +1 size attack will make a Big attack. For spells, the size is given as the actual attack size (e.g., Medium), as the size of the spell is independent of the size of the caster.
- Length : The length of a typical weapon. This also defines the wielder's melee range (half the char -acter's height plus the length of the weapon). For weapons  other  than  Medium  size,  multiply  the length by 1.6 for each size larger, or divide by 1.6 for each size smaller.
- Strength :  The strength of a typical weapon as ap -plied to breakage checks (Section 6.1).
- Weight : The weight of a typical weapon. For weap -ons other than Medium size, multiply the weight by 4 for each size larger, or divide by 4 for each size smaller.
- Fumble :  Any  unmodified  roll  between  1  and  the Fumble number results in a fumble. The fumble number  is  reduced  by  1  for  every  5  ranks  the character has in their applicable attack skill, to a minimum of 1.
- Range : For ranged attacks, the maximum range for each  range  increment.  No  modifier  applies  for attacks up to the listed Short range, a -10 modi -fier applies for attacks beyond Short range up to Medium range, etc. Crossbows also have a Point Blank range within which they gain a +20 bonus. Optionally,  range  may  be  adjusted  based  on  the attack size (see Section 9.4).

#### Small and Big Tables

The  optional  Small  and  Big  tables  incorporate  both a  critical  severity  adjustment  (one  level,  appropriate for Small or Big attacks against Medium targets) and an adjustment to the number of hits delivered (x0.75 for Small and x1.5 for Big). If the adjustment to hits delivered is not desired, use only the Medium tables. If  using  the  optional  hit  adjustments  for  larger  and smaller attacks, for attacks smaller than Small or larg -er than Big use the Medium table and multiply the hits delivered by the factor on Table 9-4a.

If the target of the attack is not Medium, modify the critical severity according to the target size as shown on  Table  9-4a.  For  example,  if  an  attack  is  made against a Big target, reduce the critical severity by one level.  The  Small  and  Big  tables  already  incorporate the adjustment for the attack size.

Due  to  the  critical  severity  adjustment  for  size,  the Small tables include criticals of less than A severity. These are denoted as Z. Roll an A critical, but find the next lower result that affects the same area of the body on the A column and apply it.

### 11. Critical Tables

Most critical effects are summarized with symbols below the description. Any number before the symbol indicates the duration (in rounds unless otherwise noted), while any number after the symbol indicates severity (e.g., hits, penalty, distance). For details, see Section 9.8.

- O +X : Additional X hits of damage
-  X : Bleeding, at X hits every round
-  (-X) : Fatigue penalty of X
-  or  (-X) : Breakage roll at -X (if given)
- -X or T(-X) : Injury penalty of X for T time period
- T  [-25/-50/-75] : Stunned at the given penalty for T rounds or timespan.
-  or  (X) : Staggered (loses 1 AP or X, if given)
-  X' : Knocked back distance of X'
-  : Knocked prone/pushed to ground
-  X% : Grappled X%
- 💀 : Target is dead, dying, or otherwise defeated (unable or unwilling to fight)
-  (X): Additional criticals of X severity

#### Critical Tables

Some critical tables represent common types of weapon strikes, some represent special types of attack, and others describe the effects of different types of energy or magic. The following critical tables are provided:

- Acid : Caustic or acidic attacks inflict acid criticals. This may be from enchanted creatures that secrete or expel acid as a defense mechanism.
- Cold : Elemental cold attacks such as from spells or magical effects inflict cold criticals, and extreme cold conditions may do so as well. (The abbrevia -tion for Cold criticals on the attack tables is O, to avoid confusion with C severity criticals.)
- Electricity :  Most  often  from  enchanted  attacks  or creatures, lightning criticals could also be inflicted from electrical devices or natural lightning. (The abbreviation for Electricity criticals is L, to avoid confusion with E severity criticals.)
- Grapple :  Grapple criticals are usually inflicted by unarmed attacks that focus on grabbing and hold -ing.  They  may  also  come  from  some  weapons such as whips.
- Heat : Natural extreme fire and heat, as well as en -chanted elemental heat attacks such as fire balls, inflict heat criticals.
- Holy : Weapons or spells from a divine source, such as from a godly being or from someone channeling the power of a godly being, may cause holy crit -icals. Holy weapons usually inflict holy criticals in  addition  to  the  normal  type  from  the  weapon itself.
- Impact :  Blunt  force  that  covers  large  areas  of  the body, such as a falling block, a fall, or ram attack, cause impact criticals.
- Krush :  Blunt  crushing  weapons  like  maces  and clubs  cause  krush  criticals.  (Krush  criticals  are abbreviated as K on the attack tables to avoid con -fusion with C severity criticals.)
- Puncture : Piercing attacks  come  from  pointed weapons  like  arrows,  stabbing  blades  like  dag -gers, or from natural weaponry like stingers.
- Slash :  Slashing  criticals  involve  a  sharp  edge  cut -ting the target, and are most often used by blades such as swords and axes.
- Steam : Heated water vapor can be scalding and in -flict serious burns, from either natural or enchant -ed sources.
- Strikes :  Unarmed  attacks  that  focus  on  punching and  kicking  are  like  crushing  attacks  causing bruising, stuns, and concussion damage, but rarely breaking the skin except with the most serious of blows. (Unarmed Strikes criticals are abbreviated as T on the attack tables.)
- Sweeps :  Unarmed  attacks  primarily  using  throws and  sweeping  attacks  are  meant  to  redirect  and use  the  foe's  weight  against  him.  These  attacks unbalance the foe and can also cause serious blunt force damage through dropping the foe or impacts with objects or walls.
- Subdual :  While subdual attacks are always meant to be non-lethal, death is still a possibility, as is serious permanent injury. Most injuries however tend to be temporary, such as fatigue, stunning, or short duration penalties.
- Unbalance :  Severe  hits  from  melee  attacks  often will  cause  secondary  criticals  in  addition  to  the normal critical type. The force behind these blows can seriously unbalance the foe causing him to fall or otherwise injure himself.
