## 1. Introduction

Throughout its long history, Rolemaster's Character Law has provided players with numerous options for creating  detailed  and  varied  characters.  The  central tenet of Character Law is that any character may learn any skill, although some professions will find it easier than  others. This  new Character Law (spanning  the first  seven  chapters  of  this  book)  keeps  most  of  the concepts  from  past  versions:  Development  Points, Skills, Professions, and Races, while dropping many rules that were exceptions. The result is a simple core game with consistent mechanics.

Some new rules have been added to clarify situations that were not addressed in old versions such as extreme temperatures, fear, and dropped objects. Perhaps most importantly, the underlying methods for creating the race,  culture,  and  profession  templates  are  based  on a system so that new templates can be created by the Gamemaster  and  in  future  products  using  the  same balanced mechanics that are presented here in Character Law .

The original Arms Law was  published  in  1980  as  a modular combat system that could be used in other role-playing games (RPGs). With unique and varied attack and critical tables, Arms Law brought a depth and perceived realism to RPG combat. It was possible to suffer broken limbs, bleed, and die from a gruesome and fatal blow. Of course, it is still a game, and actual realism is not the goal. No one really wants to play a hero who gets a tiny cut on his finger and then dies 10 days  later  from  gangrene.  What Arms Law did  provide, and has continued to provide over the following 30 years, was and is the gritty feel of realism. Com -bat is never a guaranteed win or loss. In an RPG, this translates to a greater sense of immersion and tactical choices that lead to real rewards or consequences.

There have been several versions of Arms Law since that  first  ground-breaking version, but none of them ventured too far from the original design. There were 20  Armor  Types,  weapon-specific  attack  tables  (al -though sometimes representing a group of weapons), escalating  severities  of  criticals,  and  a  built-in  me -chanic for parrying.

This new Arms Law (chapters  8  to  11  of  this  book) builds  upon  the  original  designs,  preserving  those things that were uniquely part of Rolemaster' s Arms Law ,  but  improving  those  things  which  have  been criticized over the years, removing rules which were found unnecessary, and adding rules for those things which were found to be missing. The mechanics have been streamlined, although there remain just as many or  more  choices  in  combat.  The Armor  Types  have changed to represent a greater variety of possible ar -mor types from a historical and fantasy context. The attack tables themselves have been improved to create real,  consistent  differences  against  different  armors based on our understanding of how they historically performed. However, most importantly, Arms Law remains a modular and extendable system, easily modi -fied for the purposes of your own game.

There are five books which form the foundation of this edition of Rolemaster:

Rolemaster Core Law (RMCL) contains all the core rules in three parts. Character Law contains a set of rules for creating rich and detailed characters with a complete and comprehensive skill system, as well as optional talents that can be used to enrich characters further. Arms Law contains rules for tactical combat amongst individuals and small groups using a detailed simulation of weapons and armor. Its combat system covers  the  mechanics  of  attacks  from  weapons  and animals  to  elemental  attacks.  Colorful  critical  and fumble  results  make  every  combat  interesting  and memorable. Gamemaster Law offers helpful guidance to  Gamemasters, as well as rules and guidelines for adding setting rules such as creating races, cultures, and  professions.  Poison,  disease,  and  other  hazards that may come up in play are also covered.

Creature  Law  (CL) contains  stats  for  hundreds  of animals, monsters, and fantastical creatures. Creature Law will be released in two volumes. As fantasy set -tings are often home to a variety of beasts, Creature Law II contains rules  for  creating  new  monsters  for new and unusual settings.

Spell Law (SL) is a magic system with thousands of spells organized into three realms of magic. This pro -vides characters with a wide variety of spell-using op -tions for all types of professions. Spells are organized into lists, which are related in theme.

Treasure Law (TL) is a book of treasure, equipment and commerce, an important part of any RPG. Rules for crafting mundane objects as well as magical items are included along with the Alchemist professions.

### Old versions of Rolemaster

I f you are coming to this version of Rolemaster from a RM2/Classic or RMSS/RMFRP background, you may feel  the  stat  generation  methods  given  in  Section  2.5 result in excessively average or low temps and poten -tials. The new stat table does not allow for stats over 100, and the range of what is considered average is now 48-53. So before you decide the stats are low, compare the  bonuses  you  get  for  the  stats  rather  than  just  the stats themselves, and keep in mind the following 'gut checks': A 54 here is roughly equal to an old 70, a 66 here to an old 80, a 78 here to an old 90, an 87 here to an old 94, a 95 here to an old 100, and a 100 here gives more bonus than an older system 102.

Optional Rules

In  these  rules,  you  will  see  some  rules  separated out in boxed text, like the box this text is in. Boxed rules are optional or advanced rules; you can ignore them  if  you  choose,  and  the  rest  of  the  rules  will work fine as is. These rules apply or do not apply at the GM's discretion, so if you are a player, ask the GM if any particular boxed text rule is being used.

#### 1.1. Die Rolls

1-10 (1d10): Roll one ten-sided die to obtain a result between 1 and 10. If the dice are numbered 0-9 rather than 1-10, treat results of 0 as 10. Occasionally other types of dice will be referenced (e.g., 1d6 for a six-sided die). If the appropriate type of die is not available, roll a ten-sided die and reroll any result outside the specified range (e.g., for a 1d6, reroll any result above 6).

2-20 (2d10) : Roll two ten-sided dice and add the two results  to  obtain  a  result  between  2  and  20.  Initiative uses this type of roll.

1-100 (d100) : Rolemaster primarily uses two 10-sided dice to get a result between 1 and 100, referred to as 'percentiles'. Each of the 10-sided dice gives a result between 0 and 9 - one die is treated as the 'tens' die and the other as the 'ones' die. These may be distin -guished  by  color  or  other  marking  (in  which  case  it must be made clear which die is to be read as the tens before rolling; a fixed convention for your gaming table is recommended), or one may use a pair of percentile dice where one is marked "10, 20, 30, ... , 00". (It is also  possible  to  roll  a  novelty  hundred-sided  die,  but most  gamers  find  these  impractical.)  Thus  a  random result between 01 and 100 (a '00' is treated as 100) is obtained. d100 rolls are used primarily for rolls on the critical and fumble tables.

1-100  Open-ended  (d100OE) :  An  open-ended  roll means that there is no absolute minimum or maximum. First make a 1-100 roll; a roll of 96-00 indicates that the dice are rolled again and the result added to the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and added, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total sum of these rolls is the result of the open-ended roll.

If the first roll is a 01-05 the dice are rolled again and the result subtracted from the first roll. If the second roll is 96-00, then a third roll is made and subtracted, and so on until a non 96-00 roll is made. The total of these rolls is the result of the low open-ended roll. A roll of 01-05 on anything other than the first roll does not cause one to roll again.

- Example: The GM asks a player to make an open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 99 (thus between 96 and 100). A second roll is made with a result of 96, so a third roll is made with a result of 04. Thus, the open-ended roll that the GM requested is a 199 (= 99 + 96 + 04).
- Example: The GM asks a player to make an open-ended roll, and the initial roll is a 04 (thus between 01 and 05). A second roll is made with a result of 97 (thus between 96 and 00), so a third roll is made, resulting in a 03. Thus, the open-ended roll that the GM requested is a -96 (= 04 - 97 - 03).

In some cases, the roll is only open-ended at the high end (rolls of 96-00), but results at the low end are not open-ended  as  some  other  mechanic  is  used  for  low rolls. The most common case is attack rolls, where low unmodified rolls indicate a fumble.

##### Unmodified Rolls (UM)

Certain  results  on  some  rolls  indicate  an  immediate effect and no modifications are considered. These rolls are marked with a 'UM', such as '01-04 UM'. For ex -ample, all weapon attacks result in a fumble if the initial unmodified d100OE roll falls within the fumble range of the weapon. If a roll falls into the UM range, then no modifiers are applied to the roll and the unmodified result  is  applied  (such  as  a  fumble).  When  resolving absolute  maneuvers  (see  Maneuvers,  below),  an  un -modified roll of 66 results in an unusual event. Success or failure is resolved normally with all modifications, but the outcome will be unusual in some way or have unexpected side effects.

#### 1.2. Concepts

Rolemaster is  capable  of  representing  a  wide  array of situations with a realistic feel, most of which are resolved by making maneuvers (e.g., running, picking a lock, climbing a wall, or attuning to a magical item). Maneuver rolls are made by rolling d100OE, modified by skill bonuses and situational modifiers. Characters only  make  maneuvers  for  actions  performed  under stress or pressure or if the actions are difficult enough that success is not guaranteed. Rolemaster 's rules fall into one of the areas below.

##### Skills

A character's knowledge and training is represented by their skills. Characters receive a certain number of ranks  in  particular  skills  based  on  their  cultural  up -bringing (Section 2.3), after which they may purchase additional  ranks  in  any  skills  desired  at  each  level (including 1st level). Any character may develop any skill,  but  the  difficulty  of  doing  so  depends  on  their profession (Section 2.4). Skills that are fundamental to a profession are the easiest to learn, while those unre -lated to the profession are the most difficult.

For most purposes, a character's ability is expressed as  a  skill  bonus,  derived  from  the  number  of  ranks, professional skill bonuses and knacks, their scores in the applicable stats (Section 2.5), and other modifiers. This bonus is added when performing maneuvers us -ing the skill.

Complete details regarding the skills and their use are found in chapter 3.

##### Maneuvers

Actions  are  resolved  by  making  maneuver  rolls. Maneuvers  can  be  Absolute  Maneuvers  (those  that succeed or fail, such as jumping over a chasm or pick -ing a lock) or Percentage Maneuvers (those that can have  a  variable  amount  of  success,  such  as  running or  climbing).  The  maneuver  roll  is  modified  by  the character's applicable skill as well as the difficulty of the maneuver. A maneuver is successful if the total is 101 or higher. Absolute Maneuvers may be partially successful on rolls from 76 to 100 (if possible for the maneuver) or fail outright if the total is 75 or below. Percentage  Maneuvers  achieve  various  degrees  of progress or partial success (expressed as a percentage of  the  goal)  if  the  total  is  between  1  and  100.  Both types of maneuvers may result in absolute failure or absolute success for the most extreme rolls.

Complete  details  regarding  maneuvers  are  found  in section 5.1.

##### Movement &amp; Encumbrance

Many maneuvers involve  movement,  be  it  walking, flying,  or  swimming.  How fast  one  moves and how much one is carrying can modify the difficulty of a maneuver. Movement incurs a Pace penalty to other maneuvers  performed  while  moving,  while  a  heavy load  incurs  an  Encumbrance  penalty.  Stronger  char -acters are able to carry more material before feeling the  effects  of  their  load.  Complete  details  regarding movement and encumbrance are found in sections 5.3 and 5.4.

##### Fatigue

Characters often engage in physically strenuous activ -ity (e.g., running, marching, climbing, swimming, and fighting) and run the risk of becoming fatigued. En -cumbrance, activity, hunger, sleep, and environmental factors can have a great impact on how quickly a char -acter may succumb to exhaustion. Over the course of their  activity,  characters  must  make  Endurance  rolls as Absolute Maneuvers. Success indicates continuing without tiring, while failure incurs Fatigue penalties which build up over time. If enough Fatigue accumu -lates, it may even lead to injury. Fatigue penalties may be remedied by resting. Details regarding Fatigue may be found in section 5.5.

##### Attacks

Trying to inflict harm upon another being is an attack and could be in the form of a weapon, fist, spell or any other direct violent action. An attack roll is resolved like other skills: a d100 open-ended roll is made and the appropriate attack skill bonus, called the Offensive Bonus (OB), is added. The target's Defensive Bonus (DB) is then subtracted from the total roll. The result is  determined  by  consulting  an  attack  table  for  the weapon, with the outcome based on the roll and the opponent's armor. A successful attack may inflict hits of damage and, potentially, a Critical indicating more severe  injuries.  An  unsuccessful  attack  will  yield  a miss,  but  an  extremely  low  roll  results  in  a  Fumble which may represent anything from a lost opportunity to a dropped weapon or unintentional harm to oneself or an ally.

Combat  is  inherently  dangerous  and  defense  is  im -portant. Those involved in melee may choose to Parry, dedicating some of their skill to defense rather than offense. Dodging, wearing armor, or using a shield are also options.

See chapter 8 for the combat round, determining the sequence and timing of attacks, and chapter 9 for de -tails on attacks themselves.

##### Injuries

Characters  and  their  adversaries  invariably  get  hurt while  beating  on  one  another.  The  simplest  type  of harm is in the form of concussion hits. As a character loses more and more of their hits, they begin to suffer penalties and will eventually lose consciousness and possibly their life. However, Criticals inflicted in com -bat may result in more acute types of damage, anything from bruises to broken limbs to punctured lungs, and may  incur  penalties  upon  maneuvers.  Criticals  may also  result  in  bleeding  injuries,  broken  weapons  or

armor, fatigue, or a stunned or staggered state impair -ing  the  combatant's  actions.  The  results  of  Criticals are detailed in section 9.8, while the treatment of the resulting injuries is covered in section 13.1.

##### Spellcasting

Spellcasting  is  different  than  maneuvers  due  to  the nature of magic. Casting a spell uses a smaller skill modification than attack rolls or maneuvers, based on just the number of ranks (not bonus) in the skill spe -cialization (a specific spell list) plus a single stat bonus based on the realm being used. Casters must make an open-ended roll plus bonus plus any situational modifiers. If the final roll is 1 or higher the spell has suc -cessfully been cast. Higher rolls result in spells which are harder to resist. If the final roll is 0 or less, then the spellcasting has failed. See Spell Law for more details on spell casting.

##### Resistance Rolls

Some hazards during play require a character to resist some ill effect (e.g., spell, poison, or disease). Resis -tance  Rolls  are  an  opposed  action,  where  the  RR  is made against an attack roll. Some are strictly pass/fail, while others have varying degrees of failure. Unlike maneuvers, Resistance Rolls are not modified by skill, and instead depend on the character's innate charac -teristics  (stats,  level,  talents,  and  flaws).  The  attack roll depends on the attacker's skill (e.g., Spellcasting, Poison Mastery). When no attacker skill is applicable (e.g., exposure to a natural disease), the resistance roll must exceed 50 to be successful. See section 5.6 for more details.

poweR levels

Rolemaster is suitable for campaigns focused on ordinary peasants, demigod-like heroes, or anything in between. Power levels may be used by the Gamemas -ter to adjust starting stats, knack bonuses, talent avail -ability, and power point recovery in order to better suit the tone of the game. See Section 12.1 for more details (and Table 4-0 in chapter 4 for how they affect talents).

#### 1.3. Glossary

- Absolute  Maneuvers  (AM) :  Maneuvers  that  either succeed  or  fail,  perhaps  with  some  small  chance of  partially  succeeding,  are  Absolute  Maneuvers, which are resolved with a d100OE roll plus an ap -propriate skill bonus, with a Success result on a total roll over 100.
- Base Movement Rate (BMR) :  The  speed at which a combatant moves in a round at a walking pace. An average human has a BMR of 20'/round.
- Hits :  A  measure  of  a  character's  ability  to  withstand pain and injury before falling unconscious.
- Defensive  Bonus  (DB) :  A  measure  of  a  character's quickness, evasive reactions, and magical or special effects that are defensive in nature. A character's DB is subtracted from attacks against him (Section 9.6).
- Development Points (DP) : Skills (and possibly talents or extra stat gain rolls) are bought with Development Points that are received every level. All characters receive 60 DP each level.
- Difficulty :  Maneuvers are assigned a difficulty by the GM  based  on  the  specific  maneuver  and  the  sit -uation. Difficulties grant a bonus or penalty to the maneuver roll and range from Casual (+70) to Nigh Impossible (-100).
- Endurance : A measure of the ability of a character to shrug off fatigue. An Endurance roll is used to deter -mine if the character accumulates a fatigue penalty.
- Initiative (Init) : Each combatant in combat rolls initia -tive every round. Combatants with higher initiative resolve their actions before combatants with lower initiative.
- Offensive  Bonus  (OB) :  A  measure  of  a  character's combat  skill,  strength  and  other  advantages  when fighting. A character's OB is added to his attack roll.
- Percentage  Maneuver  (PM) :  Maneuvers  that  have varying  degrees  of  success,  these  are  often  move -ment  maneuvers  that  determine  how  far  one  ran or  how  much  of  a  task  one  has  completed.  These maneuvers are resolved with a d100OE roll plus an appropriate  skill  bonus,  producing  results  ranging from failure to 150%.
- Power Points (PP) : The amount of power a spellcaster has to cast spells. PP are spent as spells are cast, with the cost equal to the level of the spell.
- Round: The base unit of time used during combat. A round is 5 seconds long.
- Skill  Ranks  and  Bonus :  Ranks  in  a  skill  represent training. Everyone starts off with 0 ranks in a skill. The skill bonus is determined based on the number of ranks (e.g., -25 for 0 ranks, +5 for 1 rank, +25 for 5 ranks).
- Statistic (Stat) : One of 10 characteristics of a character, such  as  strength,  constitution,  or  quickness.  Stats range from 1-100 and provide a bonus based on the stat and racial bonus (if any). Only this final bonus is used during play.
