## Part I: Character Law

Rolemaster provides the tools for the Game -master and players to create a world, bring it to  life,  and  participate  in  its  stories. A  char -acter is the role that will be played, and the game succeeds when that character is trans -formed from numbers on a piece of paper into something like a real person.

The rules which follow provide the pieces that may be assembled to create a unique charac -ter.  The  race,  upbringing,  training,  and  ex -periences of a character come together, each making a meaningful difference in the person that is created.

One of the main tenets of Rolemaster is that any  character  may  learn  any  skill.  Different Professions  will  have  different  development point  costs  for  a  given  skill  to  reflect  how easy or hard it is for that character to learn that specific skill, but just as a Healer can learn to wield a sword, so too can a Fighter learn how to cast spells. The exception is that characters are restricted to learning spells based on the 'Realm'  of  magic  the  character  is  innately attuned to.

Rolemaster is a relatively simple game over -all.  It  has  a  lot  of  detail,  and  that  detail  can make it appear more complicated than it really is. Everything is resolved through the roll of percentile dice. You roll, add your character's skill bonus and any modifiers assigned by the Gamemaster, and look up the result on a table to determine success or failure. It really is that simple for players. Over time, many checks will become intuitive: 'Break 100!' (Success) or 'Beat 75' (Partial Success).

Characters in Rolemaster each have:

- Ten statistics, or stats , which measure the character's raw mental and physical abili -ties.
- A race , which is the species of the charac -ter (human, dwarf, etc.). Humans are the baseline with no modifications, with racial differences  represented  by  racial  talents and flaws.
- A culture that represents the basic child -hood  experience  of  the  character.  This roughly  defines  the  character's  early  ex -periences by giving starting skill ranks in pertinent skills.
- A profession which is an archetype defin -ing which skills the character finds easier or harder to learn, which will tend to shape the character's development. This is repre -sented through different skill costs for the professions  as  well  as  professional  skill bonuses.
- A level ,  which  is  a  rough  estimate  of  a character or creature's power and ability.
- A broad selection of skills , the knowledge and  ability  to  accomplish  things  ranging from physical tasks through mental feats to magical abilities.
- Talents or flaws that  are  differences  and quirks not represented by any of the above.

Before starting down the road of adventure, each play -er must first create a character, including the charac -ter's skills and abilities. Characters have a Profession, which  determines  how  difficult  or  easy  skills  are  to develop, as well as a race (nearly always some type of humanoid) and a culture.

Roleplaying  is  neither  'storytelling'  nor  'war  gam -ing,'  and  yet  it  encompasses  elements  from  both  of these genres. In war games, the archetypes of Fighter, Thief  and  Mage  are  rigidly  enforced.  Similarly,  in many novels and stories that epitomize folktales and fantasy stories, we see many of the participants con -forming to the  same  archetypes-although this con -formity  is  considerably  less  strict  and  often  ignored for  the  central  character(s).  Once  you  move  beyond that  style  of  story,  any  conformity  to  established  ar -chetypes is a matter of choice and done purely for em -phasis. The suggestions contained within this section should enable both Gamemasters and players to inject a  wide  degree of variety and individuality into their characters.

The overall skill and ability of every character (or crea -ture)  is  indicated  by  its  level.  Characters  gain  skills and power over time. To represent this development, characters  are  awarded  Experience  Points  (EP)  that abstract  accomplishments,  life  experiences,  opportu -nities, and even time into a number. When sufficient EPs accumulate, the character gains a level. Each new level gained gives a character an opportunity to spend Development  Points  (DP)  and  gain  new  skills  and abilities.

Character Generation Checklist

The rules in the rest of this chapter give you everything you need to generate a character. The GM and players should read all of this chapter, but this checklist is a quick reference on the process of character generation. These steps do not necessarily have to be carried out in the order listed.

- 1) Think of the character concept that you want to play (section 2.1). A good concept should include:
- a. Race (Section 2.2). Your race may also grant bonuses or penalties to stat bonuses and other traits, as well as talents and flaws, and most races will provide a pool of bonus DP. Lastly, height and weight are largely determined by your race.
- b. Culture (2.3). You will receive ranks in skills based on your selected culture. Some skills are automatic (e.g., every character will recieve at least 1 ranks in Body Development), while others must be assigned (e.g., you will recieve a number of ranks which can be assigned to Crafting and Vocation skills which you may select).
- c. Profession (Section 2.4). You will select 10 Professional Skills and 2 Knacks based on your profession. For spellcasters, your profession will determine your magical realm; Arms professions must choose a realm.
- 2) Generate your character's stats (Section 2.5).
- 3) Select any talents (section 2.6) and get the GM's approval before purchasing them with DP.
- 4) Purchase your skills (section 2.6). The costs will depend on your profession.
- 5) If your character is higher than level 1, repeat steps 3 and 4 until you are done (Section 2.8).
- 6) Purchase initial equipment and calculate your bo -nuses and other parameters (Section 2.7).

### 2.1. Background

The rules provide a means of defining your character in game terms. Rolemaster generates an entity with a race, a Profession, a culture, ten stats with associated bonuses, skills, and some talents and/or flaws to round out  the  individual  in  terms  of  game  mechanics. This, however, provides only a playing piece. In order to turn this playing piece into a character, one must devote at least  a  little  attention  to  this  individual's  personality, background, and appearance.

Two  main  purposes  are  served  by  fleshing  out  the character in this way. The first is allowing the player to portray the character in a convincing and interesting manner. It is possible to simply play one's own person -ality, but even then one should consider that the same personality will develop with different social norms in a typical fantasy setting than in our 21st century world. The second main purpose is to allow the character to be integrated into the campaign and provide material for the GM to use in working the character into the story. Every character should have a reason to participate in those affairs central to the campaign. A third purpose, of somewhat lesser importance, is in assisting others to play their own characters (including the Gamemaster's portrayal of non-player characters) in relation to your character.

#### Appearance

Let us consider the simplest and most superficial of these factors first. Some aspects of a character's appearance are provided for by defined factors in the rules. Height and weight are numerically defined. The Strength stat gives some idea of musculature. There are some other obvious aspects of appearance that can be filled in such as hair and eye colors, skin complexion, facial features, and the presence of moles, birthmarks, freckles, or oth -er marks. These are largely genetic factors and while helpful in forming an image of the character, they are not the most interesting aspects of appearance.

Appearance also includes a wide range of factors that express cultural and/or individual tastes and attitudes. What is the character's hair style (including facial and body hair, when appropriate)? Does the character keep his hair combed or reserve that for special occasions, like going to temple on holy days? What kind of cloth -ing  does  the  character  wear?  Details  of  clothing  can include  fabric,  color  and  pattern,  quality  and  condi -tion, areas kept covered, and style of clothes. Does the character have any body-alterations (tattoos, piercings, scars-deliberate or otherwise, etc.)? What accessories and gear does the character wear and carry? A large va -riety of ornaments have been worn in various cultures and they can be made from many different substances: shell, stone, metal, wood, ivory, bone, horn, hair, por -cupine quills, feathers, teeth, leather, or anything else that might be regarded as attractive. Painting the body is  also  possible.  Weapons,  armor,  tools,  belts,  water skins,  and  other  functional  items  can  be  plain  or  ex -tremely fancy.

Appearance  involves  choices  and  therefore  can  be changed. If  the  others  are  visualizing  your  character, they will react differently to your Human Fighter if he is 'unwashed and ragged, wearing old furs stained with blood  and  less  identifiable  substances,  bristling  with weapons  and  wearing  a  necklace  of  humanoid  ears' than if he is 'carefully groomed, dressed in the latest fashions, but with a sense of timeless style, armed with a matching sword and dagger on an expensive weapon belt, and smelling slightly of the best cologne.'

Creating a picture of a character can help not only cre -ate a visual impression but help keep it in mind without having to frequently repeat a verbal description. If one member of the group is especially talented or interested artistically, this individual might do portraits for all the characters.

#### Character Personality

Personality  is  about  what  the  character  thinks,  feels, says, and does. Personality can be defined in great de -tail and players vary in how much they want to define in advance and how much they want to allow to develop in the course of play. Since any description is necessar -ily incomplete, there is always the opportunity to flesh out some new aspect of the character when reacting to a new experience.

There  are  numerous  questionnaires  available  on  the Internet to help define a character. Some of these are designed  for  gamers  and  other  for  writers,  but  both types serve the same purpose. Often there are far more questions than you would want to work out the answers for before getting down to the game. The key is to pick out a few questions that are especially important to this character. What defines him? What aspects of his per -sonality are going to be immediately obvious to those he  meets? Those  details  are  the  ones  that  need  to  be known in order to start portraying the character.

Mannerisms are not the most important aspect of per -sonality,  but  they  are  among  the  most  obvious.  Man -nerisms can involve conscious or unconscious habits of action (e.g., Peter the Wary always sits with his back to  a  wall),  but  frequently  mannerisms  of  speech  are the easiest to incorporate. A character may be quiet or chatty, speak directly or indirectly, use formal speech or slang and loose grammar, or employ catchphrases and professional jargon. Lisping and stuttering can be used, but may grow tiresome or may prove offensive to some. Beliefs and assumptions influence decisions and this is one area where the player must coordinate to some de -gree with the Gamemaster, as culture will have a large influence here. What religion does the character follow

<!-- image -->

(if any)? Has the character embraced some philosophi -cal or political movement? What superstitions does the character have? What attitudes does the character have towards  other  races,  cultures,  and  religions,  either  in general or specifically? What beliefs does the character have about relations between different social classes or the roles of men and women?

Attitudes shape a person's reactions. There are general attitudes and attitudes with regard to specific things. Is the character trustful or suspicious? Shy or outgoing? Confident or uncertain? What does the character like? Admire? Hate? Fear? Attitudes drive a lot of behavior and just three or four can make a character quite differ -ent from his player. Note that it is generally a good idea to make sure nobody else is planning on playing a Troll before deciding your character hates all Trolls.

Goals are another aspect that can drive character behav -ior and should be shared with the Gamemaster, as the opportunity  to  present  characters  with  possible  paths to their goals is very useful in driving the whole cam -paign forward. Goals can be short-term or long-term. Long term goals are  often  closely  tied  into  character background (e.g., Nikolai wants to destroy the Duchy of Bywood because the Duke's soldiers destroyed his village and killed his parents).

One should also consider the character's ideals and eth -ics. What does the character think he should do? What does  the  character  feel  he  should  do?  (When  the  an -swers to these questions differ, the character has an in -ternal moral conflict. Some players love to play out that kind  of  psychological  complexity;  others  wish  to  do anything else.) Finally, what does the character actually tend to do? Some characters will stick closely to their moral convictions, whereas others are weak in the face of (the right) temptation. A character might be upstand -ing most of the time, but given to failure in the face of alcohol, a pretty face, riches, deadly peril, or various other opportunities for human frailty. Is the character devoutly  religious  or  just  making  enough  display  of faith to make his grandmother happy? Is the character patriotic or possessed of other strong loyalties?

#### Group Cohesion

It is important that the group of player-characters can function  together. Although  certain  forms  of  deliber -ate tension may be fun at times, even a group at odds with  itself  needs  some  common  ground  in  order  not to  have the campaign end in mutual slaughter just as it  starts. Prejudices should either be restrained or else some strong motivation that can overcome the preju -dice, at least temporarily, should be present. It is also helpful if the group shares a fair number of ideals and has some overlap in goals. Some variation in morals is interesting; intense oppositions will lead to group disin -tegration if the characters are being played well. Shared goals make it easier for the Gamemaster to get a new adventure started: if everyone is looking for wealth, a rumor of treasure for the taking serves as a hook for all. If one character is looking for the treasure, and the other character's goal is to protect it, this party has been set up for disaster before the game even started.

#### Background

Character  background  is  about  everything  that  hap -pened to the  character  before  the  start  of  play.  This includes  the  nature  of  the  character's  homeland  and culture. While the rules provide for a general culture that  provides  some  starting  skills,  an  actual  culture is  much  more  than  that.  A  player  should  know  the location  of  his  character's  origin.  Cultural  customs, general circumstances, habits, assumptions, and such may be defined by the GM based on known details of the setting or devised by the player to round out his character. Generally, a mix of both will be involved. Keep  your  character's  starting  level  in  mind  when developing his background, as a 10th level character should have considerably more back story than a 2nd level character (see Section 12.2).

Family  is  an  important  part  of  background  and  a very useful one from the Gamemaster's perspective. Villains love to threaten your relatives, and a plague, drought or invasion becomes more personal if the PC has family back home that might be affected. Every -one has family. Even if your family is all dead, who they were and how they died is still part of your back -ground. It is unnecessary to work out every detail of family  right  away,  although  sketching  out  a  family tree  is  a  fairly  quick  exercise  in  creating  some  bare bones of background. Who are these relatives? What are they doing now? How does your character relate to each of them? Are the character's parents still alive? Is the character close to them or estranged? Siblings may be the best of allies or rivals who prove the most insidious of foes. Friends and enemies outside of the family are also important pieces of background, and current or past lovers may play a large role as well. Family relationships can also have a role in establish -ing group cohesion if the characters in the group are related to each other.

Less  close  personal  relationships  matter,  too.  It  is worth noting if you have contacts in the criminal un -derground or know some promising young magicians from an old job at the wizard's library. Most individ -uals will owe and be owed various debts, general or specific,  and  the  calling  in  of  favors  owed  can  be  a powerful weapon for the character or a plot hook for the GM. The GM should make sure that the benefits a character gets from contacts are balanced by disad -vantages. That fence the character knows might make getting rid of stolen goods easy, but he also might seek out the character for help from time to time, or rat out the character to the authorities in exchange for a re -duced sentence.

Education and training come in various types. A char -acter could have been instructed by a parent, guardian, tutor, or owner. Another character might have attended some form of public or private school. Some charac -ters  will  have  received  military  training  or  religious instruction. For some, apprenticeship will have been the  most  important  form  of  education.  A  character will have learned his skills somehow. In a more gen -eral sense, one may ask if the character is naïve, well informed,  or  misinformed  about  various  aspects  of world knowledge. A character from an isolated island may be well informed about his home island, some -what misinformed about the lands nearby, and have only vague notions of the rest of the world.

Social status is a reality of life. A character that be -longs  to  a  wealthy  or  powerful  class  will  generally be at an advantage compared to one who belongs to a  despised  class.  It  is  generally  to  be  recommended then, that characters either be of similar standing or that the GM have a game planned in which a mix of social  classes  will  be  useful  (a  gentleman  detective can mingle with the upper class, while his lower class manservant moves freely questioning the servants). If play occurs well outside the homelands of any of the characters, social class may become fairly unimport -ant. Status involves more than social class, however. An orphan may fall out of the class he was born into, while someone disowned or made an outlaw is thrown out. Government officials and members of military and police organizations have status and authority based on their societal role. Officials of other organizations, most often religions, may also have special status.

Special  circumstances  such  as  being  the  object  of omens or prophesies, being recognized as the Chosen One, having a cult following, or being the secret heir to a kingdom can all help drive a campaign and add excitement. However, they can also be overdone, fall into tired cliché, or upset everyone else's plans. Such aspects  of  character  background  especially  require coordination with the GM.

Finally, there is one's personal history. What success -es  and  failures  has  the  character  had?  For  what  has the character achieved some level of fame or infamy? Stats, talents, and flaws may be helpful here, as well as skills. If a character has a very high Quickness bo -nus,  his  player  may  decide  that  he  won  many  races in  festivals  growing  up  and  local  inhabitants  would remember him for that.

Example: Julian and Naomi decide they will create a pair of bounty hunters who work as a team. Julian is thinking he will be the outdoorsman of the duo, spending much of his life in the wilderness, some of it with his family. Naomi opts to create a stealthy character from a big city, self-reliant. Maybe an orphan? For now, they will go through the steps of character generation and fill in their backgrounds as they progress.

### 2.2. Race

This section provides a wide variety of sample races, varying in stature and innate abilities such as strength, speed, endurance, or resistance/susceptibility to mag -ic. These races include those drawn from fantasy liter -ature and the most common races in fantasy role-play -ing games, as well as others drawn from Rolemaster's history.  A  Gamemaster  should  examine  each  race carefully  before  including  it  in  his  campaign-not all these races are suitable for all settings, and some may be better suited as NPCs and adversaries rather than player characters. GMs should also feel free to customize races to fit the setting or to create new races (Section 12.5).

A character's race may grant bonuses or penalties to stat bonuses, Resistance Rolls, hits, Endurance rolls, and modify recovery time as indicated on Table 2-2a. Some races have special talents or flaws that give all characters  of  the  race  a  special  ability  or  hindrance that is not represented by simple bonuses or penalties; these are summarized in the race descriptions but for full details regarding talents and flaws see chapter 4.

Each  race  provides  a  pool  of  bonus  Development Points at character creation. Up to 25 of these points may be spent per level on talents or skill advancement during level development (Section 2.6). Most charac - ters will expend them all in their first one or two levels, but it is not required to do so. Once these points have all been expended, no further bonus DPs are received. The  Strength  stat  represents  one's  strength  as  com -pared to others of the same size. Size determines one's weight which is used for feats of strength or for resolv -ing  damage.  The  racial  strength  modifiers  therefore should be taken as relative to the average racial size. A halfling is at a huge disadvantage due to his size while arm wrestling humans, even if he has a high strength.

#### Avinarcs

A hood pulled off a dark-cloaked stranger in the back corner of a tavern may reveal an  Avinarc, with its hawklike head and its feather-covered skin. The Avinarc's once-powerful wings have become arms with dexter -ous  hands.  Only  their  heads  and  their  feathers  give them away as a non-humans. With a cloak covering them, they have the form of lightly-built humans.

Once a proud and noble race with lands and nations of their own, these bird people have slowly dwindled in number due to a powerful curse placed on them in ages past. An ancient prophecy states that the Avinarcs will one day overcome the curse and rise up again in numbers and power, but until then, they are content to while away the days with the flotsam of mankind. They are reclusive now, quietly blending in with hu -man society, quite often becoming involved with the shadier  side  of  humanity.  They  use  their  bird-like quickness and agility to aid them in thievery and skull -duggery. Though they are not inherently evil, Humans are a lesser race to them (though most would never say so) and they do not care what becomes of men or their society. Avinarcs use a variety of small hand arms or easily concealed missile weapons. If pressed in melee, they will even use their beaks.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Acute Smell II : Avinarcs gain a +10 bonus on Per -ception rolls involving smell.
- Light-Boned I : Avinarcs are treated as Small crea -tures  for  purposes  of  their  hits  (determine  nor -mally, then multiply by 0.75) and attacks against them, but not for other purposes.
- Natural Weaponry :  Avinarcs may attack using their beaks,  using  the  Beak  specialization  of  Combat Training: Unarmed skill.
- Restricted  Diet : Avinarcs  are  carnivores  and  gain no sustenance from foods other than meat.
- Sight, Eagle : Avinarc's keen eyesight permits both good  peripheral  vision  as  well  as  the  ability  to focus on distant objects, such as a hare two miles away. They gain a +20 bonus to all vision-based Perception maneuvers.
- Wings, Vestigial :  Avinarc  wings  (now  reduced  to heavily  feathered  arms)  are  too  small  for  flight, but  provide  a  +10  bonus  to  Jumping  and  when using Acrobatics to reduce the impact of a fall.

#### Dwarves

Probably  the 'toughest'  physically of the races, Dwarves are short, stocky, and ruddy of complexion, with deep-set eyes and dark wiry hair and beards (the latter they are quite proud of, growing long elaborate braids).  Dwarves  are  superior  craftsmen  and  well adapted  to  life  underground;  they  love  to  mine  the earth  for  metals  and  precious  gems,  crafting  them into powerful weapons and artifacts. Not as fertile as humans, they have few children, and less than a third of their people are women, who are guarded jealously within their cavernous halls.

| Size:           | M             | Weight, Male:   | 135 lbs.      |

| Height, Male:   | 4'6"          | Variance:       | +/- 5 lbs/in. |
| Height, Female: | 4'2"          |                 |               |

Dwarves have superior dark sight, able to see excep -tionally  well  in  dim  light  and  able  to  see  short  dis -tances  even  in  complete  darkness. They  are  slightly more  dense  than  humans,  making  it  harder  but  not impossible for them to swim (-25 to Endurance rolls while swimming). They have considerable resistance to  the  magic  of  Essence  and  Mentalism,  arts  which they have no particular talent for, but are no less ca -pable than the other races in the realm of Channeling. Dwarves are very resistant to poisons and disease, and have exceptional lifespans, up to 600 years.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Darkvision I : Dwarves can see 10' with no penalties even in complete darkness.
- Inept  V  (Endurance  while  swimming) :  Due  to their density, dwarves must work especially hard to keep from drowning. They suffer a -25 penalty on Endurance rolls while swimming.
- Nightvision :  Dwarves can see in dim light, equiv -alent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.

#### Elves

Though similar to mortal men in most ways, all types of Elves share several important, if subtle, differences. As a race, they are taller than most humans, although slender. Elven men have no facial hair, and as a rule, they have less body hair than humans. Generally, Elves are fairer in ap -pearance than their mortal brothers, having finer features, unmarred skin, and pointed ears with no earlobes.

Elven sight is extremely keen; they are able to see on a clear night as if in full daylight. Their vision is correspond -ingly restricted with less light, and they cannot see at all in total darkness. Perhaps most importantly, Elves do not age once adult or grow old, and their bodies are immune to all non-magical bacterial and viral infections. Thus, they are virtually immortal (excepting violent death).

The most otherworldly of all Elves, Fair Elves have gold -en hair, blue eyes, pale skin, and prefer garments of white, silver, and gold. Whether it is derived from divine favor or fey heritage, they have a visible aura which awes allies and intimidates foes. They are seldom seen beyond the borders of the elven lands, where they inspire their kin with their music,  magic,  and  wisdom.  Melody  and  song  frequent their gatherings, because even the least of them can play the harp or sing, while the more talented compose music or delight the ear with expertise on several instruments.

Grey elves are almost always intermediate between their more extreme brethren. Most have fair hair and blue or grey eyes. They are neither as artistic as the fair elves, as cunning and industrious as the high elves, or as sedate and rustic  as  the  wood  elves.  They form  the  middle  ground  with their pleasant company and their love of art and craft. When war  calls,  they  will  take  up

arms,  but  mostly  they  will settle down, raise a family and do as they please. They build no marble cities, but love open  cities  amongst a  lovely  landscape  which connects them closer to nature. Some live under the rule  of  High  Elves,  while others  take  to  the  seas  as merchants and travelers. They are not the most mag -ical  elves,  but  they  are  no strangers to magic either.

Raven-black  hair  distin -guishes  the  High  Elves from  their  fairer  kin -dred,  and  brown  and hazel  are  their  usual eye colors. A love of beautiful things, expressed  by  skill  in

<!-- image -->

building  and  crafting,  unites  with  a  curiosity  about  the nature of all creation to lure the most ambitious from the path of nature. Yet, the superb armor, the bright weapons, and  the  lovely  jewelry  cherished  within  their  graceful, marble-walled cities seem almost worth the price. Some of the most powerful artifacts known to exist come from the forges of these elven craftsmen. When they live among other elves, they take inspiration from the Fair Elves but willingly accept the day-to-day burden of ruling their kin.

Wood Elves  wear  greens  and  greys  to  blend  with  their surroundings.  Sandy  hair  and  light  blue,  green,  or  grey eyes complement their rustic demeanor. They are slightly shorter than other elves, though taller than humans. These Elves are the most common of all elvenkind and can be found in almost any forest across the world. Wood Elves are  often  quite  distant  from  other  elves  and  have  been known to disagree openly with the policies of the High Elves and Fair Elves. Most attuned to the subtle tides of forests,  streams,  and  the  creatures  who  roam  the  sylvan realm, Wood Elves are adept at moving silently, their pres -ence in the wood frequently going unnoticed among the shadows of swaying branches.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws (all Elves):

- Efficient Sleeper II : Elves meditate rather than sleep -ing. Two hours of meditation replaces four hours of sleep.
- Immune  to  Disease  I :  Elves  are  immune  to  all non-magical disease.
- Nightvision : Elves can see in dim light, equivalent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.

Fair Elves only:

- Defensive Aura  II :  The  aura  of  Fair  Elves  dulls  or confuses the senses of their foes, granting them +10 DB, which is not cumulative with any Aura or Blur spell.
- Golden  Throat :  Fair  Elves  have  beautiful  voices which  soothe  and  calm.  They  receive  +10  to  any maneuver  to  verbally  calm  or  persuade  (Charm, Singing, Leadership, etc.).

Wood Elves only:

- Hearing, Cat : Wood Elves have hearing as keen as a cat, allowing them to hear some high-pitched sounds and  more  accurately  determine  the  location  of  a sound's source (gaining +10 on Perception maneu -vers to locate a sound).

#### Gnolls

Small wrinkled figures with grey skin and little hair, Gnolls  inhabit  the  natural  caverns  that  abound  in mountainous  regions,  while  making  use  of  aboveground  resources.  When  sheltered  by  secrecy  and stone,  their  timid  dispositions  relax  and  permit  the enjoyment  of  gleeful  festivals.  On  these  occasions, Gnolls put aside their sober, earth-toned clothing for more  colorful  garb.  Sunlight  does  not  harm  them, but the brightness scares them and makes their eyes water  (-25  to  all  activities),  leading  Gnolls  to  favor the underground realm. It is reputed that they travel extensively to the elemental realm of earth using se -cret portals, and that their animal familiars have more than a touch of elemental nature. Skill as illusionists, dabblers and magicians (but almost never any realm but Essence) enables them to avoid encounters with other races, few gaining knowledge of their presence until after the Gnolls have passed from the area. They travel in clans and settle only in deserted grottos where access is limited and concealed, and do not remain in any one location for longer than a few years, in order to minimize the accumulating signs of their presence.

Most Gnolls avoid combat, using their spells to con -ceal themselves and provide quick escapes. Travelers are more likely to encounter Gnollish traps and illu -sions than to ever encounter Gnolls themselves. When threatened and unable to simply move on, their magic

and  stealthy  abilities  permit  them  to  strike  quickly without warning and then to disappear. However, they are not quick to forget those who have done them fa -vors. Gnolls traveling outside the clans may be attend -ing to matters for the safety of their kin, paying back significant aid they have received from outsiders, or survivors  of  catastrophes.  Gnolls  live  an  average  of 105 years.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Decreased  Size  I :  Gnolls  are  Small  creatures.  In addition  to  other  effects  of  size,  multiply  their concussion hits by 0.75.
- Nightvision : Gnolls can see in dim light, equivalent to  nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are re -duced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Light  Sensitivity  I :  Gnolls  suffer  a  -25  penalty when in bright light equal to direct sunlight, but no penalty on cloudy days or in shaded areas.
- Hearing,  Hare :  Gnolls  have  keen  hearing  in  the high and low frequency range. They can localize sounds with great accuracy and hear danger com -ing from 10 times farther than a human. They gain +20 on hearing Perception maneuvers.
- Prodigy II (IV) : Gnolls are closely attuned to their environment,  and  especially  alert  to  shifts  in weather,  which  they  use  to  conceal  their  move -ments. They receive +10 on Survival maneuvers, doubled when using the skill for weather watch -ing.

#### Gnomes

Smaller than dwarves, and appearing more frail and withered in build, long-lived Gnomes prefer to live in shallow caves where they obsessively gather knowl -edge  and  lore.  Ancient  tomes  and  rare  scrolls  litter their crowded libraries, precious chambers that usual -ly fall to ruin with a Gnome's death. A love of solitude ensures that most Gnomes remain heirless, rarely mar -rying or raising a family despite typical life spans of 600 years. Gnomes keep to themselves, but if forced into combat their foes had better be prepared for a sur -prise, for there is no telling what magical spells and/or artifacts any given Gnome will have. Although loners, Gnomes are neither shy nor joyless; generous hospi -tality accompanied by ingenious entertainments draws many friends to visit as houseguests. Gnomes do not often return these visits, for they dislike abandoning their abodes and the treasures guarded within for even a few days. Those who do often create elaborate sys -tems of traps (many of them magical in nature). Those who do marry may combine their resources, if they can agree as to how the collections should be sorted. Gnomish children are raised on a steady diet of lore, both entertaining and educational.

Young  Gnomes,  who  have  not  yet  established  their own collections, are the most prone to travel, though typically  not  without  a  small  traveling  collection  of texts. When they choose to settle, it is often at a mod -erate distance from settlements they consider friendly, especially those of Halflings, Elves, Nycameriths, or occasionally clusters of other Gnomish homes. Much less commonly, a Gnome will find a home within such settlements,  typically  only  where  there  is  a  major library  or  an  academically-oriented  guild  of  magic which can sustain enough of their interest to overcome their solitary habits.

#### Goblins

Goblins are small, about 3' tall, with thin, wiry builds. They  tend  toward  long,  narrow  heads  with  pointy chins, pointed ears without lobes, narrow noses, and thin  lips.  Their  front  teeth  are  pointed  rather  than chisel-shaped  like  humans,  and  when  agitated,  their thin lips often pull back to expose these sharp points. Common  underground  goblins  have  pale  yellow -ish  skin,  while  those  who  make  their  homes  on  the surface darken to a deep greenish color. The smaller and ruddier Kobolds and the larger muddier-colored Hobgoblins are closely related, and the three races are collectively considered goblinoids.

Goblins can see well in dim light or even somewhat in the dark, which combined with their small stature makes them well-suited to life underground. They find direct sunlight painful to their eyes and will avoid be -ing active on the surface when the sun is out.

A combination of a strong urge for dominance and a reasonable urge to flee danger due to their small size often  undermines their  ability  to  form  larger  groups and stable cultures.  Loyalty,  when  it  exists  at  all,  is reserved for close family members. Their tendency in combat to avoid direct contests of strength earns them a reputation for being sneaky, treacherous, and mean. If their lives were more secure, Goblins would reach an average age of 70, but in practice few are so lucky.

#### Gratar

Gratar  are  frog-like  humanoids,  about  man  sized  in height,  and  predominantly  amoral.  Possessing  wide drooling mouths and large bulbous eyes, these creatures are amphibians, but spend most of their time out of the water,  and  even  dwell  underground  occasionally.  Fe -male Gratar are slightly shorter but heavier of build and are physically the equal of the males.

Gratar vary in color according to their might and status, and these colors are often mistaken for different subspe -cies, but in fact Gratar change in color and even height as they age. Young Gratar are green, tend to be weak, and walk hunched over, sometimes dragging their arms. They are not very bright and easily bullied or cowed, and  their  elders  usually  seize  any  quality  equipment they manage to scrounge up. As they grow stronger and succeed in bullying their kin (usually around 4th level), their skin yellows, they adopt a bolder and more upright posture, as well as adding an inch of real height. Yellow Gratar often paint their bodies to make themselves ap -pear more fearsome, and are more likely to have pass -able armor and weapons. The most feared Gratar turn black and grow another 2". These may be the mightiest warriors (typically around 7th-9th level) or those who have learned magic to subjugate their kin.

Gratar who leave Gratar society for long periods, rarely interacting with others of their kind, gradually turn grey in color, while growing taller (similar to Black Gratar) and  leaner.  They  have  a  reputation  as  loners,  often working as assassins and killers, because more sociable Gratar  normally  remain  among  their  kin.  Grey

Gratar  typically  have  few  moral  qualms  and often make casual use of poisoned weapons.

The  rarest  type  of  Gratar  are  those  Black Gratar  who  have  dominated  many  tribes. These warlords begin to turn red around their  eyes  and  claws,  and  immediately challenge  others  who  show  the  same traits.  Those  who  have  won  many  of these battles turn completely red and are known as Royal Gratar (typically  they  will  be  at  least  15th  level by  this  point),  while  the  defeated quickly  lose their red features. Royal Gratar grow  very large and  can  be  found  leading  Gratar societies even when they are old, decrepit, and shrivelled.

Most Gratar are capable of reaching  an  age  of  100  years, but the solitary  Grey  Gratar  may  reach  150  and Royal  Gratar  have  been  known  to  reach two centuries.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Sight,  Gecko: Gratar  eyes  perform  like  those  of  a gecko, permitting additional detail close-up as well as  good  depth  vision,  and  they  do  not  lose  color vision  in  dark  conditions  (normal  penalties  for darkness still apply). They gain a +10 bonus to all vision-based Perception maneuvers.
- Recurved Musculature : Gratar are incredible jumpers with powerful legs. Their running long base  jump  is  12  feet  and  their  running  high base jump is 29 inches (standing base jumps are  half  these  values).  See  Jumping  skill  in Chapter 3 for more details about jumping. In addition, they receive a +20 bonus to Acro -batics,  Climbing,  Jumping,  and  Running maneuvers.

#### Half-Elves

The relationship between Elven and Human commu -nities may be complicated or even tense. When there is a shared threat, they may become close allies, but without a unifying cause, many Elves feel the insta -bility and rapid turnover of Human societies is some -thing that should be kept at arm's length. Nonetheless, there are those among the Elves who admire Humans' drive and passion, as well as those among the Humans who are drawn toward Elven beauty and wisdom. The dramatic  difference  in  their  lifespans  makes  lasting relationships difficult, but Half-Elven children may be the result. Half-Elves typically live in Elven or Human societies, rather than forming societies of their own. However, in regions where contact between the two races has been steady over long periods of time, mixed populations can arise and develop their own distinct cultural identities. Such populations may consist of in -dividuals with varying degrees of each ancestry, some with more Human traits and some more Elven.

Half-Elves  benefit  from  the  combination  of  Elven grace  and  Human  sturdiness.  They  are  strong  and slender, thinner than men but stouter than Elves, with thin,  angular  features.  Taking  their  coloration  from both their Human and Elven ancestors, it is not always apparent which type of Elf a Half-Elf has descended from, and those who were raised only by Humans may not know themselves. However, those descended from Wood Elves and High Elves are most likely to match the skin tones of their Human ancestors, while descen -dents of Fair Elves tend to have lighter complexions. All  Half-Elves  have  lifespans  longer  than  those  of Humans, but lack  Elven  immortality.  Humans  often find Half-Elven qualities admirable, while Elves may see them as tragically flawed or as the result of unfor -tunate choices.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Efficient  Sleeper  I :  Some  Half-Elves  meditate, while others sleep, but in either case three hours of sleep or meditation replaces four hours of sleep.
- Nightvision : Half-Elves can see in dim light, equiv -alent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.

#### Halflings

Halflings are very short, rarely more than 4' in height, and tend to be stout (trending  toward  fat  with  age). They have large, hairy feet - to the point of being 'furry'  -  that  are  almost  immune  to  cold,  and  so they often go around barefoot. They are an inoffensive people, preferring the quiet of their own villages. Lov -ers of good food and drink, they spend much of their time at inns and friends' houses, eating and drinking. Their  settlements  are  usually  focused  around  agri -culture,  but  halfling  artisans  are  not  uncommon  and they have a knack for fine detail that even the larger races  may  appreciate.  Halflings  are  happy  to  trade with  other  peoples  and  welcome  guests,  but  do  not encourage others to settle in their villages. The small scale  of  their  homes  is  enough  discouragement  for most Humans. Nonetheless, they enjoy good relations with nearby settlements that are willing to reciprocate. Most commonly these are Human, though Halflings are usually pleased to see Gnomes settle nearby.

Halflings have a high level of manual dexterity and are adept  at  moving  quietly.  When  Halfling  settlements are threatened or attacked, they favor stealth, ranged weapons, and traps, but these are last resorts and they prefer to resolve disputes through negotiation. None -theless, when pushed they can be implacable, untiring foes  due  to  an  amazing  constitution  and  can  resist even the most powerful magical and physical damage for extended periods. Their homes tend to blend into the environment, often partially or fully underground, and when necessary they will resort to tunnels, wheth -er to resist besieging forces or simply to avoid severe weather.

#### Hobgoblins

From time to time, Goblins birth unusual large offspring, who will grow into much larger adults whose skin has a muddy tinge. Only lack of numbers prevents the Hob -goblins from terrorizing all lands lit by the sky. Goblins avert  this  dread  fate  by  killing  most  of  them  at  birth. Those children who survive are prone to violent, bully -ing behavior and a significant challenge for their parents. By  adulthood,  superior  size  and  strength  offer  them dominance over those who revere the rule of brute force, and the Goblins frequently submit to a Hobgoblin king. The brilliance of the sun, although unpleasant, holds no horror  for  Hobgoblins  who  fearlessly  follow  enemies through daylight. These clever fighters are quite formi -dable on the battlefield, limited only by a lack of loyalty to each other and the cowardice of the Goblins typically under their command. Some, however, are forced out of Goblin  communities,  mainly  due  to  failed  attempts  to defeat  stronger  kin,  and  must  make  their  way  on  their own or with small groups of compatriots. They may be -come bandits or poorly-disciplined mercenaries, or join up with other Goblinoids. In any situation, they are prone to  seeking  dominance  whenever  existing  leaders  show apparent weakness.

In principle, Hobgoblin lifespans at least match those of humans, but most die quick deaths at the hands of ambi -tious or vengeful brethren when they begin to grow old and feeble. The vast majority are incapable of producing children of their own, so they do not establish Hobgoblin settlements and even Hobgoblin families are an extreme -ly unusual matter.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Darkvision II : Hobgoblins can see 20' with no penalties even in complete darkness.
- Nightvision : Hobgoblins can see in dim light, equivalent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Light Sensitivity I : Hobgoblins suffer a -25 penalty when in bright light equal to direct sunlight, but no penalty on cloudy days or in shady areas.

#### Humans

Common mortal men are the same race we are familiar with in the real world and come in the same variations of size, build, skin/hair colors and facial features as the humans we know. Highly adaptable, they can be found in just about any climate or environment and develop widely-varied cultures. Skin color tends to be darker in  sunny climates and lighter as one moves towards the poles, but these shifts take millenia and large-scale migrations and individual travel may result in notable exceptions and mixed populations. In any case, com -mon men have the same stat bonuses and other traits regardless of their place of origin or particular ances -try.  In  addition  to  these  common men, several other strains of humanity might be encountered.

Cave men are the isolated remnants of the ancestors of common men. Muscular with sloping foreheads and oversized jaws, cave men have brown or ginger hair and brown eyes, and tan skin, but are shorter than their common kin. Simple garments made of animal skins are  the  normal  garb. Their  intellect  is  not  powerful, but  a  cooperative,  good-tempered  disposition  makes their company a pleasant experience. Cave men band together to form tribes, each with its own complex set of  social  rituals  and  religious  beliefs.  Their  average life span is 50 years. Rough spears or clubs are their usual  weaponry. Those who came into conflict with common men were conquered, killed, or absorbed, so those who remain are the tribes who live in isolation.

High men are taller and stronger than common men, more lordly in appearance, longer lived, and tend to be more daring and ambitious. They are also notorious -ly stiff and rigid, not as flexible or adaptable as their common brethren, and more easily  swayed  by  their own pride or the lure of magic and power. They build great empires, but those empires often collapse spec -tacularly due to their own hubris. High men are more feared than loved, and often considered domineering. They may have the blood of gods or giants explaining both their strength and their pride. As with common men, they vary in coloration and other physical traits, depending on their places of origin and other historical factors. High men tend to build societies apart from common men, except when they conquer them, but in -dividual High men may make their name among their Common kin, for example as mercenaries.

Mixed men are the offspring  of  High  and  Common parents. They are intermediate in features and can be difficult to distinguish from either kin. Societies where High and Common humans have frequent contact may have significant populations of Mixed men.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- None .  Humans  are  the  standard  against  which  all other  races  are  compared.  However,  humans do benefit from a high number of bonus DP (as shown on Table  2-2a).  Even  the  more  powerful High  men,  despite  their  stature,  are  essentially human.

#### Hvasstonn

Also known as giantlings or great men, Hvasstonn are similar in many respects to extremely large humans, differing in their height (men average 7'6"), deeply set eyes so dark a pupil can barely be distinguished, pro -fuse short coarse grey body hair almost thick enough to be considered fur, and the sharp teeth of carnivores. Brown to olive skin is not completely hidden by their body hair, while on their heads their hair grows dark. Their features appear feral and in a scowl of anger they bare carnivorous teeth. Although nearly as intelligent as humans, their efforts at building are focused on sur -vival and warfare, for which they are well suited. To fuel their physique, Hvasstonn rely almost exclusively on meat. They live in wooden huts or find comfort -able caves which they embellish and close off to make comfortable if simple homes.

Clans  of  Hvasstonn  live  close  by  each  other  and  in times of need will come to each other's aid. In times of war, these clans band together under a Hvasstonn leader. They usually prefer to wield a weapon in each hand;  due  to  their  size,  each  weapon  is  the  size  of two-handed  human  armaments. Though  their  black -smithing and armor is primitive, it is sufficient given their might. A horde so equipped usually makes short work of any who oppose them, so the Hvasstonn can go back to their caves and flocks of sheep, pigs, hors -es,  goats  and  cows.  In  ancient  times,  it  is  rumored, they used to herd men as well, but there is no current evidence of that. In modern times they are more likely to trade as long as they are not threatened. Hvasstonn see  Trolls  as  suitable  foes  but  goblinoids  with  their tiny  tunnels  as  maddening  plagues  of  vermin.  They live to become 200, but grow feeble, grey and wizened at around 160 years.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Increased Size I :  Hvasstonn  are  Big  creatures.  In addition  to  other  effects  of  size,  multiply  their concussion hits by 1.5.
- Natural  Weaponry :  Hvasstonn  may  attack  using their sharp teeth, using the Bite specialization of Combat Training: Unarmed skill.
- Restricted  Diet :  Hvasstonn  are  carnivores.  Al -though they embellish it with the occasional plant for flavor, their substantial hunger must be satis -fied with meat.

#### Idiyva

Short,  gold-tipped  coffee-colored  fur  covers  the  lithe, well-muscled form of the Idiyva except at the face, the palms, and the soles of the feet. Smooth, brown suedelike  skin  emerges  at  these  features,  and  the  fur  on  the head  lengthens  and  lightens  to  form  a  golden  mane around the face. Green feline eyes give the Idiyva ex -cellent Nightvision; fanged teeth reveal their carnivorous nature. The toes of their feet anchor short, sharp talons, but their hands sport vicious 3" claws that retract at the knuckle into the backs of the hands, leaving the fingers free at all times. In addition to their natural claws, these felines are adept in normal melee weapons and missile weapons.  Despite  their  animalistic  appearance,  their manual dexterity  is  as  good  as  or  better  than  Humans and their artisans may be just as skilled. They also enjoy music  and  dance,  and  their  retractable  claws  offer  no impediment to the playing of most musical instruments.

Idiyva society is competitive and places a premium on personal honor. It is not unusual for disagreements (par -ticularly between males) to be settled by ritual combat, with the winner gaining not only satisfaction, but also increased  respect  in  the  eyes  of  his  peers.  Conversely, the loser (if he survives) suffers disgrace and may be cast out of the tribe, after which they may travel outside Idi -yva lands or seek a home within a far-off tribe. The most serious disputes are fought to the death.

Although Idiyva can be agreeable, they are happy to re -veal  the  fighting  instincts  of  a  predator  lurking  behind their normally civilized manners. Often a hint of that na -ture, coupled with their racial reputation, can be enough to prevent conflict. When they live among other races, many prefer occupations in which physical prowess, an intimidating nature, or the combination of the two is ad -vantageous.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Hearing, Cat : Idiyva hearing is equivalent to that of a cat, allowing them to hear some high-pitched sounds and  more  accurately  determine  the  location  of  a sound's source (gaining +10 on Perception maneu -vers to locate a sound).
- Natural  Weaponry :  Idiyva  may  attack  using  their claws,  using  the  Claw  specialization  of  Combat Training: Unarmed skill.
- Nightvision : Idiyva can see in dim light, equivalent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Restricted Diet : Idiyva are carnivores and gain no sus -tenance from foods other than meat.

#### Kobolds

Smallest of the goblinoid races, with ruddy skin and a  pair  of  horns  growing  from  their  heads,  Kobolds knuckle under to the fiercer bullying practiced by their larger  kin.  The  compassionate  wayfarer  who  feels sympathy for their piteous plight discovers his mistake when Kobold treachery rewards his  generosity  with capture by Goblins. The arts of lying, cheating, steal -ing, and flattery enable the cowardly Kobold to sur -vive within bloodthirsty Goblin society; they exercise these skills with much whimpering in all situations. In principle they are capable of reaching a life span of 75 years, but few do. Kobolds will rarely stand and fight in a straight up battle. They will wait for an ambush opportunity (or at least a surprise attack), or possibly wait for help to arrive if they cannot run away. If none of the above is possible, surrender is always an option, as they usually have little to lose. An oath of surrender, of course, will be quickly broken if the tides turn.

When  left  to  their  own  devices,  Kobolds  are  hunt -er-gatherers who supplement their supplies by pilfer -ing settlements of other races. They are not unwilling to use violence to obtain what they want, but only if the odds are clearly in their favor. When living alongside other goblinoids, much of what they gather is taken by their stronger kin and they may be even more motivat -ed to replace it, especially if Goblins or Hobgoblins will  provide  the  muscle.  Goblins  and  Kobolds  each consider the other to be expendable in such ventures, as what little loyalty they have is restricted to small family groups. Hobgoblins are rightly feared and first to be endangered or expended if the Kobold believes it can get away with it.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Decreased Size I :  Kobolds are Small creatures. In addition  to  other  effects  of  size,  multiply  their concussion hits by 0.75.
- Darkvision I : Kobolds can see 10' with no penalties even in complete darkness.
- Nightvision : Kobolds can see in dim light, equiva -lent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Light  Sensitivity  II :  Kobolds suffer a -50 penalty when in bright light equal to direct sunlight, -25 on  cloudy  days,  or  -0  in  shaded  areas  or  very cloudy days.
- Natural Weaponry, Lesser Attack :  Kobolds may attack using their claws, using the Claw special -ization  of  Combat  Training:  Unarmed  skill,  but such attacks are considered Tiny.

#### Nycamerith

Although many wonder if they are akin to Gnomes or even Halflings, these short, fat, blue-skinned beings are most likely an entire race unto themselves. Their ears are large and pointed and their eyes dance to the music that they continually play. Making their way through their long lives (up to 600 years) following The Great Song, they are a cheerful and pleasing people, rarely getting  involved  in  anything  violent,  dangerous  or risky.  Nycamerith  are  among  the  greatest  musicians and musical instrument crafters in the world. They are sometimes skilled as great craftsmen of other delicate constructions as well. Most are content to entertain in taverns and work their craft. They dwell in secluded villages located in deep valleys or on high mountains, but  will  travel  for  an  appreciative  audience.  Rarely armed, they simply do not go into hostile or danger -ous areas. When their villages are threatened despite their remote, hidden locations, they are more likely to abandon them than do battle.

Some Nycamerith feel a divine calling; for them, The Great Song is of divine origin and they feel a compul -sion to share it. Others find their music in other forms of magic, or in the pure non-magical sounds of their instruments and voices. They may feel wanderlust to explore the world and hear the music of other cultures first-hand, or simply to encounter new audiences. For a few, music becomes a metaphor which they can find

in  other  arts,  as  long  as  they  can  create  and  experi -ence new things. Whichever the case, Nycamerith are equally encouraging and appreciative of the music and arts of other races, regardless of differences in style.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Golden Throat :  Nycamerith have beautiful voices which soothe and calm. They receive +10 to any maneuver to verbally calm or persuade (Charm, Singing, Leadership, etc.).
- Hearing, Cat : Nycamerith hearing is equivalent to that  of  a  cat,  allowing  them  to  hear  some  highpitched  sounds  and  more  accurately  determine the location of a sound's source (gaining +10 on Perception maneuvers to locate a sound).
- Perfect Pitch I : Nycamerith have perfect pitch and are  able  to  reproduce  any  pitch  with  their  voice or  an  appropriate  instrument.  This  allows  them to play most pieces of music after hearing them. They receive +10 to any Performance Art: Sing -ing or Play Instrument skill. This is not cumula -tive with Golden Throat.
- Non-violent II : Nycamerith do not want to hurt oth -ers, and flinch with remorse when doing so. After inflicting a critical by any means, any action they take  in  the  following  round  suffers  a  penalty  of -40.

Orcs are similar in height to humans although  they  have  heavy  brows and  jaws  set  in  round  faces, pointed ears without lobes, thin lips that barely cover large teeth, small noses that are  almost  slits  and  small deep-set eyes.  Those  that live underground tend to be  pale  white  in  skin  tone, while those that live above ground are darker, tending toward brown tones. They are very heavy of build, as they are bred as warriors and  laborers.  They  often contend with each other for dominance and, as a result, or -ganize poorly without a very strong leader, leading  to  chaotic,  often violent  cultures.  Orcs  see  well  at night  and  have  limited  vision  even in total darkness. There are several different breeds of orcs.

Greater Orcs are tough and cun -ning, able to operate in daylight without penalty, and often the leaders of orcish tribes.

<!-- image -->

Grey  Orcs  are  highly  intelligent,  although  they  use that genius for evil and dark things. Many are spell -casters, especially Sorcerers, Clerics, and Magicians. They often work in small numbers with other types of orcs. Although they are smarter than Greater Orcs, orc society is ruled by the physically strong, and Grey Orcs are more likely to advise than rule.

Lesser Orcs are born to live, fight,  and  die  in  dark -ness;  they  hate  the  stars  and  moon,  but  panic  under the  brighter  sun.  They  make  up  the  bulk  of  the  orc population.

Scrugs  are  as  dimwitted  as  Lesser  Orcs,  but  distin -guished by their great size. They are often mistaken for ogres or trolls at a distance. While most are not dis -posed to being chieftains, Scrugs can often be found as the bodyguards of orc chieftains, although they have no regard for any other living being, even other orcs.

Vards are a four-armed mutation of Greater Orcs but keep to their own kind. They are rarely encountered with other breeds of orcs. Vards are more sensitive to sunlight  than  Greater  Orcs  but  less  so  than  the  oth -er  breeds.  Vards  can  effectively  wield  a  shield  and three  weapons,  four  different  weapons,  or  a  pair  of two-handed weapons.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws (All Orcs):

- Darkvision  I  or  II :  All  Orcs  can  see  10'  with  no penalties even in complete darkness. Lesser and Scrug Orcs extend this to 15'.
- Nightvision : All Orcs can see in dim light, equiva -lent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Light  Sensitivity :  Most  Orcs  suffer  a  -50  penalty when in bright light equal to direct sunlight, -25 on  cloudy  days,  and  no  penalty  in  shaded  con -ditions  or  on  very  cloudy  days.  Vard  Orcs  only suffer a -25 penalty in bright light, while Greater Orcs suffer no penalties at all.

Scrug Orcs only:

- Increased Size I :  Scrug Orcs are Big creatures. In addition  to  other  effects  of  size,  multiply  their concussion hits by 1.5.

Vard Orcs only:

- Ambidextrous :  Vard  Orcs  are  able  to  use  any  of their  four  hands  equally  well  for  all  maneuvers and activities. The normal -20 penalty for off-hand usage does not apply.
- Additional  Limb  Pair :  Vard  Orcs  possess  four arms. The additional arms may be used to manip -ulate and to make attacks with the usual penalties for  multiple  attacks  (see  Katas  in  Section  9.7). One  arm  may  carry  a  shield  (Vard  Orcs  cannot effectively wield multiple shields).

#### Plynos

A regal buck's or lithe doe's head graces a Human's body making this being easily identifiable as a Plynos. The deermen are herbivorous, but bucks in particular enjoy combat and battle if it is noble and honorablethey do not abide cruelty or senseless violence. They dwell in wooden cabins of their own construction and most  commonly live  in  family  clans  of  six  to  eight individuals. They can be good neighbors if their lands are respected, but have been known to become hostile or xenophobic if they feel they are being encroached upon. In regions where they are threatened, they gather in larger settlements, but the combination of external tensions and internal rivalry for status can make such arrangements short-lived.

Plynos  typically  farm,  supplemented  by  foraging  in their forests, but some hunt or trap the pelts of carni -vores to sell. Many pay homage to spirits of nature or participate in nature-centered religion. Plynos rangers and druids are not uncommon, although they are less prone  (and  even  somewhat  resistant)  to  other  types of  magic.  Their  crafts  tend  to  be  simple  and  rustic. Plynos are sometimes encountered in the company of Deer Centaurs, but are generally more aggressive than the Centaurs. Otherwise, Wood Elves are their most preferred  neighbors,  while  they  are  at  best  uncom - fortable  around  Idiyva  and  Sibbicai,  to  say  nothing of Vulfen or goblinoids. Their average life span is 80 years, and their children reach maturity several years more quickly than those of Humans.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- A cute Smell II : Plynos gain a +10 bonus on Percep -tion rolls involving smell.
- Hearing,  Cat :  Plynos  hearing  is  equivalent  to  that of  a  cat,  allowing  them  to  hear  some  high-pitched sounds and more accurately determine the location of a sound's source (gaining +10 on Perception ma -neuvers to locate a sound).
- Restricted Diet : Plynos are herbivores and cannot di -gest meat.
- Natural Weaponry : Many male Plynos have antlers powerful  enough  to  attack  with,  using  the  horn specialization of Combat Training: Unarmed skill. This is not included in the racial total, but may be purchased for 5 DP.

#### Sea-krals

Sea-krals are ape-like creatures with dark grey or blue skin and a pelt of thick, white hair growing on their head, neck, and shoulders. Females possess an addi -tional thicket that grows down the bony spine of their backs. Both genders have long arms and an extra bone connecting  the  wrist  to  the  hand.  Long,  dexterous fingers capped by a claw-like nail aid them in becom -ing  accomplished  craftsmen  and  bowmen. Although somewhat smaller  than  humans,  they  are  strong  for their size. Sea-krals fear the hungry waves, but derive too  much  pleasure  from  their  violent  way  of  life  to abandon the ocean. They build longships in which to ply the seas, raiding and plundering other vessels as pirates. Their boats serve as their only home in spite of the fact that most cannot swim. They sleep during the day and are active during the night. Leather scale armor and curved swords are their usual battle garb.

Outside of raiding and plundering, Sea-krals primarily interact with other races in port, trading their plunder for supplies. Crew members may shift between ships or occasionally even join mixed-race crews. Few will accept remaining in port for long. Some give reverence or make offerings to spirits or gods of the sea, usually in whatever temples or shrines of suitable deities may appear in a given port. Sea-krals tend to disregard the differences between such deities, which they see as the many faces of the ocean itself.

Sea-krals  are  likely  related  to  the  more  primitive land-dwelling  Garks  (see Creature  Law for  details). It is reputed that their more northerly kin, sometimes known as Ice-krals, make camps and even build set -tlements on land to better weather the storm season. The relationship between northern and southern crews vary from ship to ship, in some cases based on familial relationships.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Nightvision : Sea-krals can see in dim light, equiv -alent to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in daylight. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Extra  Joints :  Sea-kral  arms  are  multiply-jointed and agile. All physical maneuvers that depend pri -marily on their arms, including melee, throwing, and climbing, gain a +10 bonus.
- Inept  II  (Swimming) :  Sea-kral  are  poorly  suited for  swimming and suffer a -10 to all swimming maneuvers. Their extra joints offer no advantage here.

#### Sibbicai

Most likely distant kin of the more bestial Vulfen, the Sibbicai have a jackal's head and smooth, oily black, shorthaired  coats  covering  their  muscular  humanoid bodies. Their hair is long only on their heads, like that of a human, and they usually wear it either up in a crest, or long, down their backs. An intelligent and cultured people, Sibbicai fit in well with other mannish races, assuming the other races have no prejudices. However, they often feel a quiet rivalry towards Idiyva and a dis -taste for the disorder of Vulfen and goblinoids.

Sibbicai are generally quiet and subdued, yet they are quick to anger. In battle, they wear armor and use a va -riety  of  weapons. They are well-served by their keen senses and difficult to take by surprise. Their discipline and attention  to  subtle  cues  may  give  the  impression that  their  close  coordination  with  other  members  of their units is supernatural in nature. Groups of Sibbicai often hire themselves out as mercenaries, but they are very expensive. Once hired, their reputation for loyalty and upholding their promises is well justified.

Outside of battle, Sibbicai are more often herders than farmers,  but  prefer  larger  towns  over  rural  villages. Comfortable  living  among  other  races,  they  tend  to -ward trades which favor their strength and endurance, such as construction and blacksmithing. Settlements of their own tend to be well organized and orderly; some find them reminiscent of training camps. When Sibbicai choose to be religious, they are fastidious in upholding the duties and expectations of their chosen faith.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Acute Smell III : Sibbicai gain a +15 bonus on Per -ception rolls involving smell.
- Hearing, Dog : Sibbicai have hearing as sensitive as a dog, allowing them to pinpoint nearby sounds with high  accuracy  and  hear  sounds  up  to  4  times  as far away as a human, including very high-pitched sounds. This grants +10 on sound-based Perception maneuvers.
- Natural Weaponry :  Sibbicai  may  attack  by  biting, using  the  bite  specialization  of  Combat Training: Unarmed skill.
- Prodigy II (Tracking) : Sibbicai have a natural talent for tracking, in part due to their keen sense of smell. They receive a +10 bonus on Tracking maneuvers.

#### Sohleugir

Textured jade scales shimmer on the hide of the am -phibious Sohleugir, interrupted by fin-like ridges rising along the spine. These jagged spikes march from the tip of the three-foot tail to the crown of the draconic, snouted head. A transparent extra lid covers the eyes underwater or against dust in the air. The digits of their hands and feet bear translucent, claw-like nails. Sohleu -gir scales have been used to make very fine armor-of course,  no  wise  armorer  would  admit  that  he  works such feats, lest news reach these violent folk.

Sohleugir build convoluted cities of stone, corals, and shells on rocky shores next to the ocean. They cultivate the  waves  like  a  farmer  tills  the  soil,  spending  long days in the water gathering seaweed and other ocean resources. Yet they choose to dwell on the land, creat -ing  immense, briny submersion pools in every house or palace. Sohleugir are a war-like people, eager to test the points of their tridents and the courage of their spir -its,  but  cruelty  remains  absent  from  their  passion  for combat.  Sohleugir  mature  slightly  more  quickly  than Humans, but have a similar lifespan.

- Natural Armor III : Sohleugir's scales provide the protection  of  armor  type  (AT)  4  against  attacks without any encumbrance or maneuver penalties.
- Natural  Weaponry :  Sohleugir  may  attack  with their claws, using the claw specialization of Com -bat Training: Unarmed skill.
- Sight,  Gecko :  Sohleugir eyes perform like those  of  a  gecko,  permitting  additional detail close-up as well as good depth vi -sion  and  they  do  not  lose  color  vision  in dark conditions (normal penalties for darkness still apply). They gain a +10 bonus to all vision-based Perception maneuvers.
- Tetrachromatic  Vision :  Sohleugir  vision  encom -passes normal color vision as well as sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Their sense of colors differs from other  races,  and  they  are  more  sensitive  to  cues others cannot see. Penalties for spotting invisible (including hidden by the Unseen spell) and cam -ouflaged people and objects are reduced by 30.
- Third  Eyelid :  Sohleugir  eyes  have  a  transparent additional  eyelid,  or  nictating  membrane,  which protects them while still permitting sight. They are unaffected by dust, sand, or water which otherwise might limit use of their eyes.

#### Sstoi’isslythi

Slim men who move with the coiling grace of serpents, Sstoi'isslythi possess soft reptilian skins comprised of small  golden  scales.  Hair,  a  mammalian  feature,  re -mains conspicuously absent from their smooth bodies. Venom sacs, located at the neck, supply the fleshy fangs folded in their mouths with poison when danger arrives to  stiffen  these  organs  in  preparation  for  the  strike. Sstoi'isslythi  live  in  family  groups,  each  member  of which is immunized to their relatives' venom. Relations between families are surrounded by ritualized courtesy to minimize any hostility, since the strike reflex, once aroused, is impossible to quell. Dependent upon the en -vironment for warmth, the Sstoi'isslythi inhabit sunny climes that never experience the chill of winter. Wide terraces for relaxation in the heat and skylights to warm interior spaces with the sun's rays dominate their ele -gant cities.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Heatsense :  Sstoi'isslythi  have  very  sensitive  pit organs on their faces which allow them to gauge temperature at close range up to 1/1000th of a de -gree. This permits them to sense prey nearby or detect  tracks  of  prey  within  several  hours  of  its passing.  This  grants  a  bonus  up  to  +20  on  Per -ception and Tracking maneuvers to detect living creatures or other warm or cold objects, as long as the Sstoi'isslythi comes within close proximity to them or their tracks.
- Natural Weaponry : Sstoi'isslythi may attack with their fangs, using the bite specialization of Com -bat Training: Unarmed skill. Attacks are resolved on the Stinger table.
- Poison Injection : The bite of a Sstoi'isslythi injects poison. If the attack scores a critical (any sever -ity), the target must make a Physical RR against the  Sstoi'isslythi's  level  or  suffer  the  effect  of  a muscle poison (see Section 15.6 for details).
- Strike  Reflex : A  powerful  strike  reflex  allows  the Sstoi'isslythi to act with tremendous speed, gain -ing  a  +20  initiative  modifier,  when  the  reflex  is triggered  by  any  sudden  movement  towards  or away from them by a target within range of their attack. This instinctive response is impossible to quell, even if they want to; the Sstoi'isslythi must take  immediate  offensive  action  in  the  round  in which they are startled, rather than waiting to see what is happening.

#### Trolls

Trolls are large and immensely strong (usually about 9'  tall  and  massively  built),  but  mentally  slow  com -pared to most other races. Trolls are covered in a thick, hard skin that overlaps at the joints, similar to the hide of a rhinoceros. They have hands capable of fine ma -nipulation, but their fingertips end in slightly curved claws,  and  their  teeth  are  obviously  the  ripping  and tearing tools of a carnivore.

Their built-in advantages in physical or combat situa -tions along with somewhat weak minds and terrifying appearances tend to leave many trolls living out their lives  beyond  the  edge  of  civilization,  in  cultures  so loose and barbaric as to be barely worthy of the term 'culture.' Their combination of strengths and weak -nesses often makes them the target of those who would use them as shock troops, which tends to further stain their racial reputations as creatures of the dark. There may be exceptional trolls who overcome these disad -vantages, depending on the setting, but even they have to  deal  with  the  fears  and  hatreds  most  people  have toward their kind.

Trolls  cannot  stand  the  light  of  day,  suffering  a  -50 penalty to all actions in bright sunlight, but they can see well in dim light and somewhat even in total dark -ness.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Darkvision I : Trolls can see 10' with no penalties even in complete darkness.
- Inept (Influence) V :  Trolls by nature and reputation are violent and dangerous. They suffer a -25 penalty on any attempt to use Influence skills, except to provoke a fear or morale reaction.
- Increased Size I : Trolls are Big creatures. In addition to other effects of size, multiply their concussion hits by 1.5.
- Light Sensitivity II : Trolls suffer a -50 penalty when in bright light equal to direct sunlight, -25 on cloudy days, or -0 in shaded areas or very cloudy days.
- Natural Armor III : The tough hide of a troll provides the protection of armor type (AT) 4 against attacks without any encumbrance or maneuver penalties.
- Natural Weaponry :  Trolls  may  attack  with  their  claws, using  the  claw  specialization  of  Combat  Training:  Un -armed skill.
- Nightvision :  Trolls  can  see  in  dim  light,  equivalent  to nighttime conditions, as well as a human can see in day -light. All penalties for darkness are reduced by 40, except in pitch dark conditions.
- Elemental Resistance III (Cold), and Elemental Resis -tance III (Heat) : Trolls are very hardy and gain a +15 DB, RR, and Endurance bonus against cold, ice, heat, and fire. If the effect is a fixed critical and none of these modifiers apply, the severity of Cold and Heat criticals is reduced by one. These modifiers also apply to extreme environmental conditions such as traveling in an extremely hot desert or in arctic conditions.

#### Vulfen

Furred  men  with  wolfish  heads  and  tails,  Vulfen  are often confused with werewolves. Such is the fear and loathing with which Vulfen are generally regarded that this usually winds up being worse for the werewolves. Cunning intelligence shapes the behavior of Vulfen, but cruelty and bloodthirst deprive them of Mannish respect and liking. Vulfen run in packs, killing and devouring all in their path until exhaustion and sated hunger compel them to rest for a few days. They are nocturnal, sleeping by day and rampaging by night. Their lives are brutal but  usually  short,  rarely  beyond  40  years.  Their  own armament of fangs and claws is often supplemented by weapons garnered from fallen foes.

Vulfen who are ejected from their packs, usually for a failed challenge against their betters, occasionally find a  home  in  mercenary  units  where  being  intimidating can be a benefit. Even there, a reputation for excessive brutality  and  an  inability  to  stop  or  even  distinguish allies  can  result  in  the  unit  being  considered  reckless and unreliable.

Racial Talents &amp; Flaws:

- Acute  Smell  II :  Vulfen  gain  a  +10  bonus  on Perception rolls involving smell.
- Hearing,  Dog :  Vulfen  have hearing  as  sensitive  as  a dog, allowing them to pin -point  nearby  sounds  with high  accuracy  and  hear sounds up to 4 times as far  away  as  a  human, including very highpitched sounds. This grants +10 on soundbased Perception maneuvers.

· Natural Weaponry :

Vulfen may attack with their claws, using the claw specialization of Combat Training: Unarmed skill.

· Restricted Diet :

Vulfen are carni -vores and gain no sustenance from foods other than meat.

bonus, their attacks are treated as +1 Size, and they suffer no penalties due to hit loss. Instead of falling unconscious at 0 Hits, they continue to fight until they reach negative hits equal to their Body Development skill, at which point they will fall unconscious. Once unconscious they must make a Physical RR each round until they either fail (and die) or are healed enough hits to be above this threshold. While frenzied, they get no Defensive Bonus other than that due to magic and are unable to allocate OB to parry attacks. Furthermore, they will always attack the closest creature (medium Perception roll required to distinguish friend from foe) and an Adrenal Focus maneuver is required to exit the frenzied rage. If there are no animate targets left to attack, they will destroy anything else within reach until knocked unconscious or they make a successful maneuver to come out of frenzy.

Example: Julian opts for a Sibbicai. A reputation for high-priced mercenary work sounds great, while their talent for tracking fits the role he sees for the character. Naomi decides she will play a Human, taking advantage of their adaptability and their ability to fit in most places.

Height &amp; Weight

Height  and  weight  are  largely  determined  by  one's race, although there can be significant variation within a single race. Taller races generally have faster paces due to stride, although they cannot take advantage of cover as easily as those that are smaller.

To obtain the average weight for a character's height, use the weight given in Table 2-2b and for every inch over or under average height, add or subtract the giv -en lbs/inch. Characters can deviate from the average build, being thinner or heavier than average, although it is rare to be more than about 30% from this average without being under or overweight in a manner that is unhealthy. For any weight over 130% of average, the additional weight counts as weight carried for purpos -es of Encumbrance (Section 5.4).

Example: Blottis, a human of portly stature, is quite tall at 6'4". Average weight is 185 + (5 x 6) = 215 lbs., while Blottis weighs 310 lbs., 44% over average. He is treated as if he was carrying a load equal to 44% - 30% = 14%.

If randomization of height and weight is desired, roll 1d10, 2d10, or 3d10 as shown for the race's size (e.g., Humans use the Medium values while Halflings use the Small values) to determine the height. Determine the average weight for that height as described above. Then  roll  d10  to  determine  build  and  consult  Table 2-2b.

Example: Base height for a human is 5'10, and the player decides to roll for random variation. Humans are Medium sized, so he rolls 2d10 and gets a 13. 13 - 11 = +2 inches, which is 5' 12" or 6' even. A 6' tall human starts with a base weight of 185 + 2 (inches) x 5 = 195 pounds. He rolls a 9 for build, meaning he is 'heavy'. His weight is increased by 3d10% for a final weight that will range from 201 pounds to 254 pounds. The 3d10 roll is 10, and 195 x 110% = 214.5 pounds.

Individual Stride

The given stride modifier for each race assumes all members of the race have an equivalent stride based on average racial height. If stride modifiers are de -sired on an individual basis, adjust the stride modi -fier by 1 for each 6" the character is taller (increased stride)  or  shorter  (reduced  stride)  than  their  racial average. Note that some races are simply faster or slower than stride alone would otherwise suggest.

### 2.3. Culture

A culture should be chosen based on the character's upbringing. For some races, there is a default culture associated with that race (e.g., Dwarves are stereotyp -ically from an underground culture), but for other rac -es  many different cultural backgrounds are common (e.g., Humans have many different cultures). With the GM's approval, races and cultures could be mixed to best match the character's formative years. The GM might determine that certain Professions are not ideal -ly suited to all races or cultures.

The people whom the character grew up around deter -mine his cultural background. If the character grew up as the child of a peasant in a rural feudal culture, he will be different from a character that grew up as the child of a fisherman in an urban despotic culture, even if  both  are  of  the  same  race  and  profession.  Factors like language, skill preferences, weapon preferences, religion, general outlook, prejudices, and many other traits will be affected by the culture in which the char -acter was raised.

The character's culture grants ranks that are assigned to skills prior to Level 1, representing childhood learn -ing. The ranks given are shown in Table 2-3 for each of the given cultures. Ranks given for 'Composition &amp; Perf. Art'  may  be  chosen  from  any  Composition or Performance Art skill, while 'Crafting &amp; Vocation' may  be  selected  from  Crafting  or  Vocation  skills, although  the  culture  should  help  determine  what  is typically  available  and  suggestions  are  listed  below for each culture. Specializations are listed for crafts; selecting a specialization is normally not required but may spur ideas in developing a character's personal history. The 'Cost' column is used for modifying cul -tures or creating new cultures (Section 12.6).

The ranks of languages given must be allocated be -tween spoken/written and may be in more than one language (e.g., you could speak and write Erlini at 5 ranks each, or you could speak Erlini at 5 ranks, write Erlini at 3 ranks, and speak Shay at 2 ranks). (Addi -tional ranks may be purchased as skills.) Most charac -ters should have at least 5 ranks spoken in their native language, or 6-8 if they are well educated.

A character's fluency and literacy in a particular lan -guage are determined by the skill rank that the char -acter has achieved in the spoken and written forms of that language. The Gamemaster should decide which languages are available to be learned during character generation for each of the Cultures in his world system. Characters may then expand on this base through skill development as they are exposed to new languages.

#### Cosmopolitan

When a city  gets  large  enough,  those  who  dwell  in it  cease  to  be  merely  urban  in  culture.  Large  cities tend  to  have  very  finely  specialized  craftsmen,  and the majority of their economy is devoted to trade and commerce. The combination of specialization, access to resources and cultural experiences you only find in large  urban  areas,  and  exposure  to  other  people  via trade and travel create a culture that is cosmopolitan.

Crafts : Large, diverse cities foster specialization and support a wide range of crafts. Any craft is appro -priate.

Vocations :  Bookkeeper, guardsman, librarian, man -ager,  merchant,  officer,  scribe,  soldier,  valet,  or any type of craftsman.

#### Harsh

This  culture  represents  people  living  in  wastelands, though  the  type  can  vary.  Tundra,  ice  shelves,  lava fields, true deserts, or even some form of chemically or  magically  hostile  wasteland  all  apply.  People  in these cultures live on the edge of survival and tend to be very focused on survival skills applicable to their harsh environment.

Crafts : Culinary (cook), Leathercraft (tanner, leather craft,  armorer),  Metalcraft  (blacksmith,  weapon smith, armorer), Woodcraft (carpenter).

Vocations : Hunter, trapper, shaman, guide.

#### Highland

Highlanders live in rough hills or mountainous terrain. They are usually somewhat isolated by the local ge -ography and limited in food sources by a lack of flat land. They tend to engage in limited agriculture and herding.

Crafts : Culinary (cook, brewer, butcher), Fabric Craft (any), Leathercraft (any), Metalcraft (blacksmith, weapon smith, armorer), Stonecraft (mason, stone dresser,  potter),  Woodcraft  (sawyer,  carpenter, cart wright, cooper).

Vocations :  Herdsman, farmer, weaver, stonemason, carpenter, soldier, miner.

#### Mariner

Mariner cultures are usually located along the shores of  an  ocean,  lake,  or  river,  and  their  economies  are usually fishing and trade based. They get the majority of their subsistence from the water, though they may also engage in herding or agriculture.

Crafts : Culinary (cook, brewer), Fabric Craft (tailor, seamstress,  rope  braider),  Leathercraft  (leather worker, armorer), Metalcraft (blacksmith, foundry worker, weapon smith, armorer), Woodcraft (car -penter, ship wright, cooper).

Vocations :  Sailor,  soldier,  pirate,  fisherman,  chan -dler, ship builder, sailmaker.

<!-- image -->

#### Nomad

Nomadic  cultures  tend  to  center  around  herding  or hunting, driving their food supply with them or fol -lowing its  migrations.  Mounts  and  herd  animals  are the core of their lives, and they tend to be far more focused on portable property and less focused on land ownership than non-nomads.

- Crafts : Culinary (cook), Fabric Craft (spinster, dyer, tailor,  weaver,  seamstress),  Leathercraft  (tanner, leather worker, tent maker, armorer, girdler).
- Vocations :  Herdsman, scout, guard, weaver, leather worker.

#### Reaver

Reavers represent a society of raiders, generally found in  badlands adjacent to a more settled culture. They live by preying on the productivity of others, though they may also engage in herding or agriculture on a limited basis.

- Crafts : Culinary (cook), Leathercraft (tanner, leather worker, armorer), Metalcraft (blacksmith, weapon smith, armorer).
- Vocations : Raider, hunter, scout, bonesetter, shaman.

#### Rural

Most of the above cultures take place in rural envi -ronments, but this culture specifically refers to people who dwell in the rural areas of relatively open, settled lands. Rural people are usually farmers of some sort, tied to the land they tend. Some rural dwellers are en -gaged in crafts, but they tend to be small scale and ori -ented toward local use. Rural dwellers generally have a symbiotic relationship with nearby urban dwellers, exchanging food and raw materials for most of their manufactured goods.

- Crafts : Culinary  (cook, brewer, butcher,  cheese maker),  Fabric  Craft  (any),  Leathercraft  (any), Metalcraft (blacksmith, weapon smith, armorer), Stonecraft (mason, stone dresser, potter), Wood -craft (sawyer, carpenter, cart wright, cooper).
- Vocations : Farmer, herdsman, militia, weaver, tinker, stonemason, carpenter.

#### Sylvan

Sylvan peoples are woodland dwellers who may prac -tice some limited herding and/or farming, but mostly live  by  hunting  and  gathering  in  their  rich  environ -ment. These cultures tend to be spread out with low populations, as high concentrations of people often re -sult in the forest being cleared and the culture shifting to a new type.

Crafts : Culinary (any), Fabric Craft (any), Leather -craft  (tanner,  leather  worker,  cobbler,  armorer), Metalcraft (blacksmith, weapon smith), Stonecraft (potter), Woodcraft (sawyer, carpenter, cooper).

Vocations : Hunter, farmer, scout, weaver, carpenter, leather worker.

#### Underground

People  who  spend  most  or  all  of  their  time  under -ground  or  inside  vast  structures  are  of  this  culture. Some steady supply of food must be available, be it animal herds, fungus farms, or fishing, or else the cul -ture becomes fully dependent on trade for food (those that raid for food become Reavers).

Crafts : Culinary (cook, brewer, butcher, cheese mak -er), Fabric Craft (spinster, dyer, tailor, weaver, seam -stress),  Leathercraft (tanner, leather worker, cobbler, armorer), Metalcraft (any), Stonecraft (any).

Vocations : Miner, soldier, blacksmith, fungus farmer, explorer, scout.

#### Urban

Urban dwellers are the people who live in the towns and small cities of a settled area. They tend to be skilled specialists or craftsmen, and usually live a symbiotic existence  with  the  rural  people  of  their  region,  ex -changing finished goods for food and raw materials.

Crafts : As with the Cosmopolitan culture, any craft is appropriate.

Vocations :  Bookkeeper, guardsman, librarian, man -ager, merchant, officer, scribe, soldier, valet, any type of craftsman.

   

Example: Julian considers Reaver, but decides he wants to be a bit more civilized than that. Still, he envisions his character coming from tougher terrain, so he picks Highland. He decides his Melee Weapons skill will be in Pole-Arm, and he will use a spear. His Composition/Performance Art skill (1 rank) will be playing the drums. His Crafting/Vocation skills (4 ranks) will be Leathercrafting so he can repair his armor, and a Vocation skill in Bounty Hunter which should at least cover knowledge of normal procedures, where bounty hunters learn about bounties, and how to turn in their marks.

Naomi is torn between Cosmopolitan and Urban, but ultimately decides she has come from a smaller Urban city. She uses her Composition/Performance Art ranks (3) for one rank of Music (singing) and two ranks of Acting. She has seven ranks in Crafting/Vocation skills, so she distributes them between Drawing/Painting (might be useful for wanted posters), Culinary (could make travel in the wilderness more pleasant), Metalcraft (taking care of weaponry), and a Vocation as a Thief which should be helpful when making contacts among the criminal element.

N ow that they have picked a race and culture, they also choose names: Kirax and Thyrzia.

### 2.4. Profession

Rolemaster professions are not professions in the typ -ical sense of a job or occupation. A profession encap -sulates a character's foundational experiences during childhood-experiences  that  determine  the  ease  (or difficulty)  with  which  the  character  will  be  able  to develop his skills-and genetic predispositions. They determine how difficult  it  is  to  learn  skills  and  thus make it easier for a character to focus on certain abil -ities, while making others more difficult to learn, but not impossible.

Characters are not restricted from learning any skill (except for some spell lists), so it is easy to develop unique characters that are variations from the profes -sion archetypes. For example, the Fighter profession has  low  costs  in  combat  and  physical  skills,  which encourages development of those skills typically as -cribed to a fighter, however the character is free to take any  other  skill,  even  magical  skills,  at  higher  costs. A character's profession determines four aspects of a character.

1. Skill Costs : Skill costs (given in Development Points) are shown on Table 2-4a and represent the relative ease with which skills can be learned. For each skill, two numbers are shown, separated by a slash. The first number is the cost of a single rank of the skill, and the second number is the cost of the second rank. For example, 2/4 indicates the first rank will cost 2 DP, and the second rank will cost an additional 4 DP. The four combat training categories (listed 'Combat Training 1', 'Combat Training 2', etc.) are costs for the four combat training skills. When a character is created, the player must assign these costs to the actual combat training categories (Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Shield, and Unarmed) in whichever order is preferred.
2. Professional Skills : Each profession has skills that define their core strengths. These may be honed through constant use and training or reflect innate ability. These skills may be selected to receive additional bonuses, which apply to all specializations of the selected skills:
- a. Professional Bonuses : Due to constant use and practice, a character chooses 10 skills (from the 15 listed) to get a bonus of +1 per rank in that skill, to a maximum of +30.
- b. Knacks : Characters also have skills with which they find themselves particularly adept, a sort of natural ability. A character chooses 2 skills (from the 15 listed) that each get a fixed +5 bonus. The bonus and number of skills can vary if the GM uses a different Power Level (Section 12.1).
3. Realm : For spellcasters, one's profession determines one's realm. Arms professions must choose a realm (Channeling, Essence, or Mentalism). A character's realm stat is the stat used for casting magical spells and is based on one's realm. For the realm of Channeling, this is Intuition, for Essence it is Empathy, and for Mentalism it is Presence. For Hybrid casters, who use more than one realm of magic, the realm stat bonus is the lower of the two realm stats (e.g., for a Sorcerer of Channeling/Essence, use the lower of his Intuition and Empathy bonuses). All characters (and creatures) get +10 to RRs versus their own realm.
4. Spell Lists : Each spellcaster profession (semi, pure, or hybrid spellcasters) gains six base spell lists that are customized for the profession. The spell lists are given in Spell Law .

Professions  are  grouped  based  on  their  exposure  to, and  use  of,  magic.  Arms  Professions,  such  as  the Fighter or Thief, have limited access to magical skills. Semi spellcasters combine a focus on arms along with magic (normally a single realm), gaining limited mag -ical capabilities. Pure spellcasters focus on one realm of magic, at the expense of combat and physical skills. Finally,  Hybrid  spellcasters  combine  two  realms  of magic allowing them to learn a wider variety of spells. The description  of  each  realm  notes  suggested  stats which are important for professions of that realm. The stats are fully explained in Section 2.5.

- Example: Julian considers making his character Kirax a Fighter for martial ability, or a Rogue to get some outdoors skill plus some stealth, but ultimately decides a Ranger will have a more interesting relationship with nature. He assigns one Knack to Melee Weapons, along with a professional bonus. With 5 ranks (+25), the professional bonus is +5 and the Knack for another +5, for +35 plus his stat bonus (still to be determined). The other Knack goes to Stalking, where he has 4 ranks (+20) for a total of +29 plus stat bonus.

Naomi chooses to do without magic, and also considers Rogue, but elects to play a Thief instead. No one is better at sneaking, and a Thief will also be better at handling social interactions. She assigns one of her character Thyrzia's Knacks to Melee Weapons, along with a professional bonus. With 4 ranks (+20), the professional skill bonus adds another +4 and the Knack +5 for a total of +29 plus her stat bonus. The second Knack goes to Influence. She's planning to develop two separate specializations (Charm and Duping), and the bonuses will apply to all specializations of the skill. With 4 ranks in each, both specializations are raised to +29 plus stat bonus.

No Profession

The 'No Profession' is a set of well-rounded skill costs used  for  creating  cultures.  It  can  also  optionally  be used in place of using professions at all. The No Pro -fession does not focus on any particular set of skills. While the No Profession offers very broad access, it does  nothing  very  efficiently  and  will  fall  behind  if mixed in with the other professions. It is intended for use in a campaign where the GM wishes to eliminate professions and have all characters developed by only their choices of skills. If using the No Profession in this way the GM may allow the character to select a set of 6 base spell lists and pick 10 professional skills from any of the categories (subject to GM approval).

#### The Realm of Arms

Arms professions concentrate primarily on non-magical skills, including weapons, armor, athletics, subterfuge, and perception. As a result, they will find it difficult to learn spells and other magical skills. Arms users still must select one of the three realms of magic during character generation. Suggested Stats: Agility, Constitution, Quickness, Self-Discipline, Strength .

Rogue

Rogues are the generalists of adventurous Arms users. They can learn a handful of weapons almost as easily as a Fighter and subterfuge/mechanical skills almost as well as a Thief. Rogues can also pick up athletic skills (including Body Development), additional com -bat skills, and outdoor skills readily. Rogues make a good choice if you want to be a good combatant and also  dabble  in  multiple  non-combat  areas. Professional skills: Riding, Perception, Body Development, Maneuvering  in  Armor,  Restricted  Quarters,  Blind Fighting, Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Survival, Jumping,  Poison  Mastery,  Climbing,  Running,  Ambush, Stalking .

Thief

Thieves  are  specialists  at  stealth  and  subtlety.  They have an easy time learning mechanical skills such as picking locks and disarming traps and are fairly good at picking up weapon skills. Thieves are also adept at subterfuge and many athletics skills (such as climb -ing). They rarely wear heavy armor, but light armor

<!-- image -->

does not especially hinder their professional abilities. A thief may pursue a life of larceny, but they are also well  suited  as  scouts  and  spies. Professional  skills: Perception,  Melee  Weapons,  Ranged  Weapons,  Acrobatics,  Contortions, Climbing, Running, Influence, Social  Awareness,  Trading,  Concealment,  Stalking, Trickery, Locks, Traps .

Fighter

Fighters are the primary combat specialists. A fight -er  may  be  a  heavily  armored  mounted  knight,  a swashbuckling musketeer, a big brute with a massive bronze-bound  club,  an  honor-obsessed  samurai,  or a master archer. The face of battle may change with technology and social organization, but there will al -ways be those who specialize in being in the middle of it all.

Instead, Scholars focus on the academ -ic  skills  used  in  their  vocations.  They  are  better  at learning spells than are other arms users, though not on par with the true spell-casting Professions.

The realm of channeling offers significant power as well as a diversity of capabilities. It is well known for healing, which is available to anyone using its magic, for countering unholy threats such as undead and demons, and empowering the holy warriors known as paladins. Yet it is also capable of informa -tion-gathering, elemental manipulations, and magical defense. Nevertheless, ask any magician whether they would trade realms and the answer will be a definitive "no." Why is that? It is because, of the three realms, channeling incurs the greatest cost. Its power is offered in exchange for a lifetime - or longer - of service to a divine will, and the consequences of disloyalty or even distraction from the cause may be severe.

2/4

Before  war,  before  scholarly  research, before  cities,  indeed  before  civilization, there were people seeking to survive in the wilds of nature. Their struggles were small and personal, against the elements, against starvation,  against  powerful  animals  and creatures  that  would  hunt  them.  It  was  in this time that the connections between mortals and the divine were first forged, and so nature magic has always held an important place within the realm of channeling. Some druids and rangers have a place within organized  and  structured  religions  devoted to deities of the natural world, while others find  their  own  individual  path  answering the call of the nameless awe they feel in a sheltered grove or standing at the foot of a mountain.

#### The Realm of Essence

Essence is the power that exists in everyone and everything. It has been known in other sources as the Tao, Magic, Unified Field, the Force, etc. An Essence user taps this power field, molds it, and diverts it into spells. The Realm Stat for Essence is Empathy, reflecting the ability of the Essence user to open themselves to the subtle sensations outside oneself. Suggested Stats: Empathy, Memory, Reasoning .

Magician

Magicians are Pure Spellcasters who have concentrated on elemental spells. Their base spells deal with the six elements  of Rolemaster :  earth,  fire,  ice,  light  (which includes electricity), water, and wind. They have many spells  that  hurl  bolts  and  balls  of  these  elements  to potentially deadly effect and thus Magicians are often found on battlefields. They can also learn all manner of magical skills with ease. Professional skills: Attunement, Runes, Spell Lore, Grace, Directed Spell, Power Development, Power Projection, Architecture, Astronomy, Engineering, Mathematics, Magical Ritual, Open Spell Lists, Closed Spell Lists, Base Spell Lists .

Of the three realms, it is essence that is the realm of what is real and tangible. It wields the power of the elements, shaping and throwing and projecting and modifying and understanding them to a degree that easily surpasses mentalism and channeling. It may examine the history and nature of a tangible object, or offer perfection to physical movements or sounds. And of course, to a magician, essence itself becomes real and tangible, so it may be used to manipulate magic itself.

For those unfamiliar with magic, it  can be a surprise that the seemingly subtle arts of illusion are found alongside the real and tangible elemental magics. The explanation  for  this  is  simple:  illusions are real. An illusion may not be exactly what it appears to be, but the image is real, and may be seen by anyone at any distance. The sounds are real and may be heard even by unseen ears. Illusions may even have physical, tangible sensation, and this is real as well, at least until sufficient  force  is  used  to  shatter  the physical aspect. An illusion is every bit as real as a painting, it just happens to use essence as its canvas.

In terms of sheer power, mentalism is clearly the least of the three realms of magic. It is the most limited by the capacity of the caster, usually able to affect only a single target, and in many cases its spells require the target to have a true mind. Yet mentalism does not suffer from being the most subtle of the magical arts. The ability to befriend or control another person is a potent power indeed. It may deceive a target's senses while onlookers remain none the wiser, or discreetly interrogate their very thoughts. Mentalism may be used to repair or empower the body of the caster, and is the least impaired by the restrictions of armor. The mentalist may be aware of every mind in their vicinity, making them difficult to take by surprise. A mentalist is a useful advisor, if they can be trusted to merely advise and not control.

#### Hybrid Realms

Hybrid Spellcasters combine the powers of two different realms of magic. This provides the spell caster with great flexibility, providing access to a great many spell lists, although at the price of suffering the limitations of both Realms. The Realm Stat for Hybrids is the lower of the two stats associated with the Realms the Hybrid has access to. Suggested Stats: Memory, Reasoning and the two appropriate realm stats (Empathy, Intuition, or Presence) .

Healer

Healers combine the realms of Channeling and Men -talism  (Intuition  and  Presence  Realm  Stats).  They have  concentrated  on  spells  of  self-healing  and  the ability to take the injuries of others upon themselves. Thus, a Healer could heal a person by taking the in -jury of the patient upon himself and then healing this injury gradually. They can easily learn both Body De -velopment (to help survive this process) and medical skills (to help others short of taking on their wounds). Professional  skills:  Body  Development,  Attunement, Racial  Lore,  Grace,  Herbalism,  Medicine,  Meditation, Mental Focus, Channeling, Power Development, Social Awareness, Magical Ritual, Open Spell Lists, Closed Spell Lists, Base Spell Lists .

### 2.5. Stats

The base mental and physical attributes of a character are represented by 10 statistics (referred to as stats). Stat  values  range  from  1  to  100,  which  provides  a basis  for  comparison  among  characters  of  the  same race. The lower the value of a stat, the weaker it is; the higher the stat, the stronger it is. These ten stats in -clude physical and mental attributes such as Strength, Agility, Reasoning, and Self-Discipline.

An  individual's  stats  represent  prowess  in  various areas  in  comparison  to  the  average  member  of  that race, with an 'Average' Stat within the range of 4259. Stats in the 'Above Average' (60-83) or 'Below Average'  (18-41)  ranges  are  less  common  and  far enough from average to be noticeable after spending some time in the character's presence. Least common are  'Deficient'  (1-17)  and  'Exceptional'  (84-100) which would stand out even from a short encounter or in large groups ( e.g., Borin is the strongest dwarf in the kingdom, or the moment you talk to Sedgewick you know he has a hard time understanding things ).

Two sets of stats are generated: temporary stats rep -resent  a  character's  current  stats,  and  potential  stats represent the character's maximum possible develop -ment. During play, the temporary stats can rise due to practice and training whereas potential stats rarely, if ever, change. Note that a character's stats do not al -ways increase beyond their starting value as they still require  effort  to  improve:  two  months  of  travelling and adventure does not necessarily accomplish what 18 years of youthful exuberance failed to.

- Ag ility (Ag) - Agility is a combination of manual dexterity, grace, and fine motor control. Agile char -acters move with ease and even poise; characters with  low  agility  may  be  clumsy  or  imprecise  in their movements.
- Constitution (Co) - Constitution is general health and well-being, resistance to disease, and the abil -ity  to  absorb  physical  damage.  Characters  with high Constitution stats are healthy and tend to be sturdily built. Those with low Constitution may be excessively thin or overweight, and could be prone to colds, persistent coughs, allergies, or other minor ailments.

- Empathy (Em) - Empathy is the ability  to  perceive  the  emotional states  of  others  and  the  capacity to form emotional attachments to persons, places, or things. It also is  the  realm  stat  for  Essence,  as the complex magical fields of the Essence are in some ways analogous  to  a  living  thing.  Empathic characters are often amicable, understanding,  and  even  protec -tive  of  others.  Those  with  low Empathy  are  more  likely  to  be unconcerned  about  the  feelings of  others,  and  cruel,  dishonest, antagonistic,  or  insincere.  Some are merely oblivious, although even  that  may  be  misinterpreted as arrogant or patronizing.
- Intuition (In) - Intuition is a combination  of  subconscious  think -ing,  luck,  genius,  precognition, and  the  favor  of  the  gods,  all  of which  are  embodied  in  this  stat. This provides the ability to draw conclusions or make  decisions quickly, without stopping for deep consideration. It is the realm stat for  Channeling.  Intuitive  charac -ters  are  often  creative,  imagina -tive, and open to new experiences. Characters with poor Intuition are more likely to be hidebound, in -curious, reactionary, or stubborn.
- Memory  (Me) -  Memory  is  the ability to retain what has previous -ly been encountered and learned. Characters  with  good  Memory are  often  mindful  and  attentive, and enjoy study and learning. Those  with  poor  Memory  may seem  inattentive  or  thoughtless, absent-minded, or forgetful.
- Presence  (Pr) -  Presence  is  the sense  of  self  and  the  ability  to project  one's  personality  to  af -fect or control others. It includes

projecting  mentally-focused  magic  and  serves  as the realm stat for Mentalism. Characters with high Presence  are  usually  outgoing  and  gregarious, although  their  assertiveness  and  enthusiasm  may sometimes rub people the wrong way. Those with low Presence are more prone to timidity, introver -sion, or even underconfidence and pessimism.

- Quickness  (Qu) -  Quickness  is  a measure of speed, reflexes,  and  con -scious reaction time. Quick characters move rapidly and will often do so first, and tend to be active and high-energy. Characters  with  low  Quickness  may be slow or even lethargic.
- Reasoning (Re) - Reasoning is the ability  to  take  available  information and  draw  logical  conclusions.  Those who Reason well are often orderly in their thinking and may be prudent and dutiful, perfectionistic, or goal-orient -ed. Those who Reason poorly may be impatient and rash, distracted and dis -ordered. At best these traits may come across as spontaneous and instinctive.
- Self-Discipline  (SD) -  Self-Discipline  is  the  amount  of  control  of mind over the body, the ability to stay focused  or  push  harder  or  longer  in pursuit of some goal, or to draw upon the inner reserves of will inherent in any individual. Characters with strong Self-Discipline  are  temperate,  confi -dent,  and  even-tempered.  They  may be outgoing but are equally likely to be  guarded  and  private.  Those  with poor  Self-Discipline  may  be  self-indulgent,  nervous,  quick-tempered  or moody.
- Strength (St) - Strength is not just brute  musculature  but  the  ability  to use  existing  muscles  to  the  greatest advantage.  Strength  is  rated  relative to size; both one's Strength and one's own  weight  are  considered  in  deter -mining  how  much  one  can  lift,  for example. Strong characters may have muscular  bulk  or  may  be  lean  and wiry, but tend to be active. Weak char -acters may be scrawny or flabby, traits which may arise from genetics or out of pure laziness.

The value of  the  stat  is  used  to  de -termine the stat bonus as indicated in Table 2-5a. The stat itself is not used in play, but rather the stat bonus is used as a modifier to skills and actions. Each skill category has two as -signed stats whose bonuses are added to a third stat for the individual skill to determine the total skill bonus.

Different races may provide a bonus or a penalty to the stat bonus (not the stat itself). Humans are considered to be the benchmark and therefore have no racial stat modifiers. Thus, an average dwarf with a Strength of 50 is stronger than an average human with an identical Strength of 50 since the dwarf gets +2 to his Strength bonus (Section 2.2).

Example: The stat bonus for Combat Training: Melee Weapons is St+Ag for the Combat Training category and St for the Melee Weapons skill. If Lexxa has a 71 Strength (+3) and an 85 Agility (+6) she would add 3 + 6 + 3 = 12. Lexxa gets a +12 stat bonus to all Combat Training: Melee Weapon specializations.

In addition to skills, stats affect several other character qualities  such  as  defense,  pace,  resistance  to  spells, and encumbrance penalties.

Defensive  Bonus  (DB) :  A  character  benefits  defen -sively from his Quickness. Regardless of whether or not a character has any defensive skills, he may add 3x his Quickness bonus to his Defensive Bonus provided he is not completely still or surprised (Section 9.6).

Encumbrance : Carrying and wearing enough equip -ment and armor can give maneuver penalties, which can be offset by Strength (Section 5.4).

I nitiative :  The  character's  Quickness  bonus  or  pen -alty modifies initiative rolls in combat (Section 8.3).

Movement Speed : Half of the character's Quickness bonus (round up) adds to (or subtracts from) the char -acter's Base Movement Rate of 20'/round. Note this is further modified by race or, optionally, height (Section 2.2).

Resistance  Rolls  (RR) : Resistance  Rolls  against spells, fear, poison, and disease are affected by various stat bonuses depending on the type of 'attack' (Section 5.6).

- Physical : Constitution
- Fear : Self-Discipline
- Channeling-based magic : Intuition
- Essence-based magic : Empathy
- Mentalism-based magic : Presence

#### Generating Stats

For each of the 10 Stats roll d100 three times, rerolling any value lower than 11 until a value of at least 11 is obtained. For each stat, the highest roll is the charac -ter's potential for that stat, while the middle roll is the character's starting temporary stat. The lowest roll is discarded. (For campaigns where higher or lower stats should be the norm, see Power Level in Section 12.1.)

You may then pick any two of the following boosts (or pick one twice):

-  Replace  any  one  stat's  temporary  and/or  potential with 56 and 78 respectively.
-  Replace  your  highest  temporary  stat  with  90  and boost its potential by 10 (to a maximum of 100). Raise the potential to the temporary value if the potential is lower.
-  Replace your second-highest temporary stat with 85 and boost its potential by 10 (to a maximum of 100). Raise the potential to the temporary value if the potential is lower.
-  Make two stat gain rolls (see the next section) for the same or two different stats.

The player is then allowed to make up to two swaps, switching  the  temporary/potential  pair  for  one  stat with the temporary/potential pair for another stat. This allows a player to play the desired profession while having  variability  among  stats.  GMs  may  alter  the number of swaps if they wish, from none, all the way to placing any temporary/potential pair in any stat.

- Example: After rerolling numbers less than 11, Julian has rolled Agility 21 (34 potential), Constitution 65 (73), Empathy 35 (86), Intuition 76 (78), Memory 33 (39), Presence 73 (81), Quickness 62 (63), Reasoning 41 (64), Self-Discipline 91 (91), and Strength 67 (78). Agility and Strength are important for combat, Constitution for withstanding harm, and Intuition for Channeling magic (including that of Rangers), so those seem to be the most important stats for his character Kirax. He chooses to swap his Self-Discipline with Strength, and Presence with Agility. A Strength of 91 is great, but he decides to replace it with a 90 so he can raise his potential to 100. His second-highest stat is Intuition, so he raises that to 85, raising the potential to 88. His final stats are Agility 73 (81), Constitution 65 (73), Empathy 35 (86), Intuition 85 (88), Memory 33 (39), Presence 21 (34), Quickness 62 (63), Reasoning 41 (64), Self-Discipline 67 (78), and Strength 90 (100).

After a similar process, Naomi settles on Agility 83 (95), Constitution 75 (97), Empathy 59 (97), Intuition 48 (58), Memory 52 (84), Presence 62 (85), Quickness 90 (99), Reasoning 47 (71), Self-Discipline 45 (46), and Strength 56 (78) for her character Thyrzia.

Purchasing Stats

Some Gamemasters will prefer to have players buy their  stats  with  a  set  number  of  points  rather  than relying  on  the  randomness  of  the  dice,  or  even  al -low them a choice of rolling or buying. Buying stats allows  players  to  accurately  model  a  preconceived character concept.

Roll the potentials as normal, including any swaps but none of the adjustments, and discard the rolled temporaries  and  purchase  temporaries  instead.  No temporary may exceed the rolled potential. Each stat costs points equal to the bonus, thus a stat of 50 has a cost of 0, while stats above 50 cost points and stats below 50 cost 'negative' points (i.e., they give points back).  When  purchasing  stats  at  character  genera -tion, use the highest number in the stat range for the stat bonus purchased (e.g., spending 2 points gives a stat of 65, while spending -7 points results in a stat of 14).

Characters get 15 points to buy stats when creating their  character.  The  Gamemaster  may  alter  these  points based on the power level of the game (Section 12.1).

#### Stat Gains

Stats can rise from their temporaries up to their potentials over time. Stats have the  opportunity  to  go  up  every  level, starting  at  2nd  level;  however,  not  all will  go  up,  and  some  may  never  reach their potential. This represents the char -acter focusing on improving certain stats; they will often be those most used by the skills the character develops.

### 2.6. Skills &amp; Talents

With  profession,  race,  culture,  and  stats  in  hand,  it is now time to make the core of the character: skills. Development Points (DP) are spent each level to de -velop  and  train  ranks  in  skills.  Training  and  natural

| Table 2-5b: Stat   | Stat Gains Die   |
|--------------------|------------------|
| 1 - 6              | d3 - 1           |
| 7 - 8              | d3               |
| 9 - 18             | d6               |
| 19 - 81            | d10              |
| 82 - 90            | d6               |
| 91 - 92            | d3               |
| 93 - 99            | d3 - 1           |

Every time a character goes up a level, or  for  level  2  and  above  when  creating  a  character beyond 1st level, pick two stats to get a stat gain roll (or one stat to get two rolls). Look up the current (tem -porary) value in Table 2-5b to determine what die is used for the roll. Roll that die type and add the result to the temporary stat. Stats cannot be raised above their potential value. Stat gains may also be purchased with Development Points. Additional Stat Gain rolls may be purchased for 4 DP each.

aptitude  (based  on  stats)  affect  one's chance of accomplishing certain actions and activities  (e.g.,  fighting,  maneuver -ing, spellcasting, etc.). The complete list of skills and descriptions is in Chapter 3. Costs for skills are determined by one's profession (Section 2.4).

Characters  start  with  60  DP  each  level plus  a  number  of  bonus  DP  based  on race. The bonus DP may be spent on tal -ents at character creation or spent during early levels instead. Up to 25 bonus DP are  spent  each  level  until  they  are  all spent  (e.g.,  a  human  who  spends  nothing  on  talents gets 60 + 25 = 85 DP for each of Level 1 and 2).

The GM may also allow characters to spend DP on tal -ents. While some races automatically receive special talents, other abilities, whether cultural or individual, may be purchased as talents and flaws. While skills are trained in small increments over time, talents and flaws rather represent (dis)abilities or conditions that

one either has or does not. While skills can be taken many times over to improve them, talents are taken once or a limited number of times, depending on the talent.  Descriptions  for  the  talents  and  flaws,  along with their DP costs (which are the same for all Profes -sions), are in Chapter 4.

Example: Takko spent much of his childhood helping his grandfather prepare medicines and poisons, so he was exposed to non-lethal doses of many toxins over a long period of time; this has trained his body to be more resistant to poisons than is normal. The player and GM agree that Takko should purchase the Physical Resistance talent at Tier II (+10 to RRs vs. Physical Resistance Rolls) for 10 DP, even though normally this is a racial talent.

Example: Volosha who begins as a Fighter of the Langur may be able to ride a horse extremely well because her nomadic people are taught to ride at an extremely early age even for Nomads. The GM decides that the character may begin the game not only with the cultural ranks a nomad receives, but also the Prodigy (Riding) II talent (for 12 DP), which gives her +10 to Riding.

### 2.7. Finishing Touches

To finalize the character, the player needs to calculate the character's bonuses such as skill bonuses, Resis -tance Rolls, etc. Use the following checklist to finalize the character.

- Base Movement Rate is equal to 20'/round modified by half Quickness bonus (round up) and a stride modifier based on race (or height if the Individual Stride option is used).
- Skill Bonuses are summed from stat bonuses, rank bonuses from training, professional bonuses, knacks, and special modifiers such as talents.
- Hits are  equal  to  the  Base  Hits  for  the  character's race, plus the Body Development skill bonus. For Small characters, multiply this total by 0.75. For Big characters, multiply it by 1.5. For characters who are sizes other than Small, Medium, and Big, see Table 9-4a.
- Defensive Bonus is equal to 3x the Quickness stat bonus.
- Endurance is equal to the Body Development skill bonus plus the endurance modifier for the charac -ter's race.
- Encumbrance is  given  as  a  percentage  of  body weight. Add total equipment weight as a percent -age and any armor encumbrance (see Section 5.4 for more information).
- Equipment is purchased by the character with start -ing money (see Chapter 6 for equipment costs and suggestions for starting money depending on the tone of the campaign).
- Armor Type is  a  number  from  1  to  10  based  on the armor being worn on the torso, ranging from AT 1 for no armor to AT 10 for plate armor. Also make note of any piecemeal armor locations (e.g., heavier armor on the arms). (See Section 7.2 for details regarding armor.)
- Initiative bonus is equal to the character's Quick -ness stat bonus.
- Power  Points are  equal  to  the  character's  Power Development skill bonus.
- Resistance Roll bonuses (for 5 different types) are each based on a single stat, plus a modifier due to race, +2 per level (see Section 5.6), and +10 for magic of the character's own Realm.

### 2.8. Advancement

When his character advances a level, the player gets 60 Development Points to spend (and possibly bonus points  based  on  race  at  low  levels).  This  is  usually spent on skills, although the Gamemaster may allow talents to be purchased or improved. All of the char -acter's DP are normally spent; if for some reason the character  wants  to  save  up  DP,  perhaps  toward  an expensive talent, he needs to get the GM's approval before saving those DP for later use.

Development Points are spent to learn new skills or improve  existing  skills  (i.e.,  increase  the  character's rank  in  a  skill).  If  a  character  advances  a  level  and wants to take a new skill that he has not spent any time practicing or learning about, the GM may disallow it to be taken and require that the character wait until the following level to take a rank in the skill. Alternative -ly, he may allow a training period and a delay in DP spending until training is done.

Example: Martok the Magician wants to learn a new list: Fire Law. The GM tells Martok he must locate a tutor to teach him Fire Law, pay this tutor 40 silver, and spend a few weeks studying. When Martok advances a level he can then spend the DP and take the ranks in Fire Law.

Example: Mhairi spends part of most sessions entertaining and singing ballads in local taverns, while meeting all sorts of interesting, and sometimes dangerous, folk. When Mhairi advances a level she wants to take ranks in Music and Influence: Charm. Because she has obviously been practicing these skills during play, the GM allows her to purchase ranks in them without needing a tutor or training time.

<!-- image -->

In  addition,  pick  two  stats  to  get  a  stat  gain  roll  (or one stat to get two rolls), as detailed in Section 2.5. Additional stat gains may be purchased for 4 DP each.

Once all Development Points have been spent, there are several items on the character sheet that will need to be updated.

- Stat  bonuses for  skills  for  any  stat  whose  bonus changed as a result of a stat gain.
- Rank bonus in any skill in which ranks were taken.
- Professional  bonus for  any  Professional  skill  in which ranks were taken.
- Special modifiers to skills from any talents or flaws which  were  gained,  removed,  or  had  their  Tier changed.
- Total skill bonuses for any skill that was changed by one or more of the above 4 items.
- New spells for any new ranks taken in spell lists.
- Hits and Endurance if  Body Development bonus changed.
- Total  Power Points if  Power  Development  bonus changed.
- Encumbrance if Strength bonus changed
- Defensive Bonus if Quickness bonus changed.
- Resistance  Rolls ,  noting  if  stat  bonuses  changed and increasing by +2 per level.
- Level, EP to next level : an additional 10,000 expe -rience points are required to reach each level (e.g., a total of 30,000 experience points are required for third level).
- Weight  Allowance if  the  Strength  stat  bonus  has improved.
- Base Movement Rate and Initiative bonus  if  the Quickness stat bonus has improved.
-  Update any of the above for any additional talents or flaws not yet accounted for.

Example: Julian and Naomi's gamemaster has decided they will start as 2nd level characters, since 1st level characters are typically mere children or apprentices. (For more discussion of starting level, see section 12.2.) Their complete stats are on the following pages:

Chapter 3: Skills

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A character is largely defined by his skills, which de -fine what he knows and how well he knows it. Skills can  be  practiced  and  improved  upon  over  time,  al -though they eventually reach a point of diminishing returns where they receive smaller improvements for the same amount of work.

Skills  are  listed  according  to  thematic  categories  on Table  3-0a. All  skills  within  a  category  (except  for Combat  Training  and  Spellcasting)  have  the  same Development  Point  cost,  category  stat  bonuses,  and often a shared method of resolution. In addition to the category stat bonuses, each skill has its own stat which is also added to the skill total (e.g. Animal Handling adds  the  Agility  and  Empathy  stat  bonuses  for  the category in addition to Presence for the skill). Some skills require specialization when they are developed, which can be developed for multiple specializations (e.g., 'Riding' is developed as 'Riding: Horse' or 'Rid -ing: Giant Eagle' and each one is learned as if it were a separate skill).

The  included  skills  are  those  that  will  be  common across most campaigns. Some settings may have new skills,  or  not  use  others,  most commonly among the Crafting and Lore categories where crafts, languages and lores will draw heavily upon the setting and envi -ronment. The skills themselves are not intended as a complete or exhaustive listing; however, the catego -ries are general enough so that any new skill can be added to an existing category.

### Developing Skills

Characters  receive  60  Development  Points  (DP)  to spend each level, beginning at level 1. At lower levels additional  bonus  DP  may  be  available  according  to one's race (Section 2.2). The cost of developing a skill is  determined  by  the  character's  profession  (Section 2.4).

It is a basic premise of Character Law that the early years in which learning patterns are formed, prejudic -es established, and attitudes molded are more import -ant than a few years of study and travelling; therefore a character's skill rank in an area never affects the cost of improving that skill. A Magician who has become a near expert with a sword is still a Magician and must pay more to increase his skill with a sword than a neo -phyte Fighter. Every character is capable of learning any skill, but those that do not come naturally require more time and effort to master.

Skills  are  presumed  to  derive  from  study  and  expe -rience  over  time.  Characters  do  not  advance  a  level and then suddenly require time to learn skills; rather, learning  is  a  continuing  process.  Depending  on  the skill and the circumstances, the GM may require ac -cess to a teacher, books, or other learning aids. Many GMs may especially wish to use such requirements to limit the learning of spell lists (see Spell Law ).

Skill  costs  are  given  for  each  profession  (Section 2.4). Each skill is listed with two costs separated by a slash (e.g., '5/7'). The first cost is the price in DP for learning a single rank of a skill at a given level. The second cost is the price in DP for learning a second rank during the same level. No more than two ranks of a given skill may be purchased each level. Some skills have specializations that  are  listed  at  the  end  of  the skill description. The skill is learned in one of these specializations  and  multiple  specializations  may  be taken at the same cost, just as if they were different skills.

Example: Kelgryn's cost for Riding is 2/3, so he learns one rank in Riding: Horse for 2 DP. If he also wants to develop one rank in Riding: Giant Eagle, this will also cost 2 DP . So, if he learns both, the total cost is 2 + 2 = 4 DP . However, if he wants to develop two ranks in Riding: Horse, it would cost 2 DP for the first rank and 3 DP for the second, for a total of 5 DP .

Intense Training

A character may wish to focus intently and train in one specific skill in order to learn it faster than nor -mal. A fighter may wish to learn a new weapon at high level, or a magician may find a new spell list. The  GM may allow this,  although  he  may  require that the character have access to special facilities or a teacher (e.g., focused research in a library). The skill is then developed using the 2nd Development Point cost for all further ranks taken that level.

No more than one skill each level should be allowed to develop rapidly. Furthermore, a character cannot rapidly develop a skill if he already has ranks equal to twice his level or more (e.g., a Level 5 thief cannot rapidly develop his short sword skill past 10 ranks). Lore skills (including Languages) are exempt from this limit.

Example: Kelgryn  decides  he  wants  to  develop  3 ranks in Riding: Horse. The GM allows it since Kelgryn is currently immersed in a riding culture and is using a horse to travel the area. His cost for Riding is 2/3, so he pays 2 DP for the first rank and 3 DP each for the second and third ranks, for a total cost of 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 DP.

#### Skill Bonus

A character's skill bonus is the sum of learned abili -ty, innate characteristics, and other special modifiers. While  some  skills  use  this  bonus  in  different  ways, in most cases the total skill bonus is used as a direct modifier to maneuver rolls which are categorized by difficulty and can also be modified by situational fac -tors, such as injuries, lighting, or terrain. Some skills will also use the number of skill ranks for certain uses of the skill.

Total Skill Bonus = Rank Bonus + Knack +

Professional Bonus + Stat Bonus + Special Modifiers

Rank Bonus : Determined by the number of ranks in the skill (Table 3-0b).

Knacks : Every character has an exceptional personal gift in two skills (each a fixed +5 bonus) selected from a list based on their profession (Section 2.4).

Professional Bonus :  Each character gets a bonus of +1 per rank (up to a maximum of +30) in 10 skills cho -sen from a list of skills determined by the character's profession.

Stat  Bonus :  Each  skill  gains  a  bonus  from  the  two stats associated with the skill category and a third stat dependent on the skill itself (with the exception of the Battle Expertise, Combat Expertise, and Magical Ex -pertise skills which use no stats).

| Table 3-0b: Skill Ranks   |         |
|---------------------------|---------|
| 0                         | -25     |
| 1 - 10                    | +5/rank |
| 11 - 20                   | +3/rank |
| 21 - 30                   | +2/rank |
| 31+                       | +1/rank |

Special Modifiers :  Individual  skills  may  have  addi -tional modifiers given in the description. Superior or inferior  equipment  may  offer  additional  bonuses  or penalties (for details see Treasure Law ). Talents may also  apply  special  modifiers  to  skills  in  some  situa -tions (Chapter 4). With no ranks, the character is as -sumed to be untrained, with a modifier of -25, which is eliminated by the development of the first rank. All other modifiers for rank are cumulative.  The first 10 ranks are worth +5 each, the next 10 ranks add +3 per rank, the next 10 ranks after that add +2 per rank, and all ranks beyond the first 30 provide +1 per rank. The progression is summarized in Table 3-0b.

- Example: Mokosha has 37 ranks in Riding. A skill with 37 ranks has a skill rank bonus of 10 ranks x 5 = 50, plus 10 ranks x 3 = 30, plus 10 ranks x 2 = 20, plus 7 ranks x 1 = 7. 50 + 30 + 20 + 7 = +107 total skill rank bonus. Her Ag+Em+Pr total bonus is +10. Riding is one of her professional skills, so she gets +1/rank (to 30 ranks max) or +30. She also took a Knack in Riding for +5. She has no talent that applies to riding, her quarterhorse offers a +10 bonus and her saddle and tack are not special enough to warrant a bonus.

This makes her total bonus 107 (ranks) + 10 (stats) + 30 (Professional Bonus) + 5 (knack) + 10 (quarterhorse) = +162 for the Riding skill.

#### Similar Skills

It often arises that a character does not have the skill required for a given maneuver. A character may find himself with a weapon he has not used, trying to re -call information he may have picked up learning other lores, or attempting a new craft which is similar to a known craft. The  player  may  choose  to  use  a  simi -lar skill in place of the skill they lack, sometimes in a  novel  manner.  In  these  cases,  the  GM  will  decide how similar the skill is based on the current situation. Similar skills are not restricted to replacing unknown skills. A character may be so good in a similar skill that he is better using that skill as a similar skill than the  actual  skill.    However  similar  skills  only  impart bonuses,  they  never  grant  any  ranks  in  any  similar skills,  even  for  skills  where  the  number  of  ranks  is important (e.g., Shield, Ambush, spell lists).

The similar skill is used in place of the original skill, with  a  penalty  based  on  the  relationship  of  the  two skills, and how similar the GM determines them to be, as shown in Table 3-0c. A maneuver can be consid -ered as made up of techniques used (e.g., swimming strokes,  meditation, swings and parries) and a focus or subject (e.g., a horse, the environment, or a blade). A modifier applies based on three categories of simi -larity.

- Very Similar (0) skills are those that have signifi -cant overlap in techniques to be used as well as a similar focus.
- Similar (-25)  skills  are  those  that  share  either  the same techniques or the same focus.
- Slightly Similar (-50) skills are those that have little overlap in techniques and/or focus.

A few specific and general examples follow of how to use these guidelines to decide on appropriate pen -alties  for  similar  skills.  Some  of  the  examples  may seem absurd (e.g., using Region Lore to swim), but they demonstrate the flexibility of these simple rules. Players often make decent arguments for why a skill may be applicable in a given situation.

| Table 3-0c: Skill Similarity         | Table 3-0c: Skill Similarity   |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Skill relation                       | Penalty                        |
| Same skill, different specialization | -25                            |
| Same category, different skill       | -50                            |
| Different category                   | -75                            |
| Similarity                           | Penalty                        |
| Very similar                         | 0                              |
| Similar                              | -25                            |
| Slightly similar                     | -50                            |

Example: Garath is a virtuoso with a hand axe (hafted weapon), but has never picked up a long axe (greater hafted weapon) before. Since they are both specializations of the same skill (melee) the penalty starts at -25. The hand axe and long axe are both hafted weapons, and both utilize swinging attacks using a similar motion, so would be very similar (0 for a total of -25). A hand axe and a scimitar on the other hand are both bladed weapons but use different methods of attacking so would be similar (-25 for a total of -50). A hand axe and spear would be only slightly similar (-50 for a total of -75) since there is little similarity between the techniques or the type of weapon.

Example: Volosha is an accomplished rider, with +80 in Riding: Horse. However, in the desert where she has found herself, there are nothing but camels. These are different specializations of the same skill so the penalty is -25 to start. The GM decides the techniques are the same and the camel, being a domesticated four-legged land beast, is similar to a horse making the skills very similar. The total penalty is a -25. A giant eagle would be similar (-25 for a total of -50), while a dolphin would be slightly similar (-50 for a total of -75) since the animals are nothing alike and the techniques only overlap marginally.

Example: Torsk-krift finds himself in the river when his boat has capsized (due to foul play). Fortunately, he is holding onto the boat moving downriver, but unfortunately he does not know how to swim. The player asks if Torsk-krift can use his Region Lore skill to get to safety. After all, he knows the river well and although he cannot swim, he might know which part of the river may be shallow enough to push off from the boat and wade to shore. The GM allows it and assigns a penalty of -75 for being in different categories, and a -25 for being similar (he knows about the river, but Region Lore imparts nothing about swimming techniques). The total penalty for trying to use Region Lore to 'swim' is -100.

Example: Perception and Tracking are in the same category, but different skills, giving a -50. They share virtually the same techniques, as well as a similar subject (the environment). The total penalty to use Tracking in place of Perception, or Perception in place of Tracking, would be -50.

Example: A skilled horse rider would know something about handling horses, even if he has not taken skill in Animal Handling. Since they are different skills (-50) but share a subject (horse) and techniques (in controlling the horse), the penalty would be -50.

Example: Locks and Traps are two different skills (-50), but some traps may share a lot of similarities with locks. Traps that are embedded within locks use similar mechanics, and similar techniques for disarming them, and would be considered very similar giving a total penalty of -50. However, a pressure plate trap is not similar and therefore would only be considered similar (-75), or even just slightly similar (-100) depending on the mechanism and access to it.

#### Complementary Skills

Complementary  skills  are  skills  that  work  together. This  could  be  a  single  character  that  has  multiple skills  that  are  applicable  to  a  task,  or  multiple  char -acters may work together to attempt a task. The GM determines what the primary skill is, and its bonus is used in full. The number of ranks in the first comple -mentary skill (or character) are added, and the ranks of each additional complementary skill (or character) the GM allows is further halved (the 3rd is one-half, the 4th is one-quarter, etc.). The GM is the final arbiter here, and if in doubt or dispute, the default answer as to whether a second skill or character can be used to boost another skill is 'no'.

Sometimes  working  together  is  not  about  collabo -ration  to  improve  one's  chances,  but  rather  is  about shortening the time needed to perform a task. A group of  soldiers  may  spread  out  to  find  something,  or  a group of cooks may want to put together a 5-course meal. The Gamemaster will assign a difficulty based on the task and situation, and a maneuver using the average skill bonus of all involved is made. Having an effective leader can help a group work more effi -ciently, thus if there is an acting leader he may add his ranks in his Leadership skill.

ROLEMASTER UNIFIED ^ Character Law

<!-- image -->

Example: Roza has a Perception bonus of +90, and is looking for concealed traps as she walks up the corridor. Roza also has 12 ranks in Technical (Traps) with a +80 bonus. The GM decides that Roza's familiarity with mechanical traps will help her in locating concealed traps, so allows her to add her ranks in Traps as a secondary bonus to her perception. Her skill bonus in Traps is not used. Thus her total bonus is 90 + 12 = +102. Roza's player argues that since she has 10 ranks in Region Lore for the area she is in, she should get another 10 ÷ 2 = +5 bonus, but the GM rules that knowledge of a large region is not going to be helpful in this case.

Example: Roza has a perception bonus of +90, her friend Borlo has a perception of +70, and Borlo' s sister Kamina has a perception bonus of +75 and 10 ranks of leadership. The three friends are attempting to find a key that was thrown into the large, overgrown yard in front of an old house, and the GM states that it would take one person 30 minutes to search the whole yard. Working together, they can search the area faster, Kamina splits up the work and coordinates the effort (putting her leadership into play) and they begin to search. The average of their perception bonuses is (90 + 70 + 75) = 235 / 3 = 78 and adding Kamina's 10 ranks in leadership gives 88. Just one perception maneuver is made at +88. It would take one person thirty minutes to search, so for three it takes just 10 minutes (30 / 3 = 10), so they get one perception maneuver at +88 for every 10 minutes they spend searching. The GM decides this will be resolved as a Percentage Maneuver, since the key is definitely there in the long grass, and will eventually be found if they keep looking.

#### Conflicting Skills

Conflicting skills are when two characters are working in opposition and in order for one to succeed, the other must fail,  and  vice  versa. This  covers  cases  such  as a character using Stalking to avoid a character using Perception or two characters arm wrestling.

Conflicting skills may be resolved as either Absolute Maneuvers or Percentage Maneuvers. In both cases, the  GM  will  declare  one  character  to  be  active  and the other to be passive. Both make maneuver rolls as normal. All modifiers (including difficulty) that might affect  either  character  should  be  considered,  and  all should modify only the active maneuver roll.

<!-- image -->

Example: Taor is trying to sneak out of the dim and shadowy Rusty Nail tavern at closing, but the barmaid is looking for him to pay his tab. Stalking is the passive action while Perception is the active one, since ultimately the result of the Perception maneuver will determine Taor's success or failure. Because of the shadows, it is easier to stalk and also harder to perceive, but the penalty should be applied only once, to the active (Perception) roll.

Absolute Maneuvers are resolved by giving the active character a modifier to his maneuver roll equal to 100 minus  the  final  result  of  the  passive  character.  The modifier could be positive or negative.

Example: Arlaina is trying to sneak past a guard. The guard has been on duty for 6 hours, and the packed dirt of the ground makes little noise so the GM decides on a base difficulty of routine, or +30. Arlaina rolls a 34 + 70 (Stalking skill) + 30 (routine) = a final result of 134. The guard has a Perception bonus of +45, and the GM assigns a -20 penalty due to the shadows. He also has a penalty of 100-134 = -34 due to Arlaina's Stalking result. He rolls a 60 + 45 - 20 - 34 = 51. The guard fails to see Arlaina as she sneaks past.

Example: A couple of hours later, Arlaina attempts to sneak back past the same guard station. There are now two guards present: the same guard as before and a new guard taking over. The GM judges that two guards are a little harder to get past, but they are somewhat distracted by the shift change, so he leaves the stalking difficulty at routine. Arlaina rolls 27 + 70 (skill) + 30 (routine) = 127. The first guard rolls 65 + 45 (skill) - 20 (shadows) - 27 (Arlaina's success) = 63 and again is unaware of the intrusion. The new guard is an Elf, whose Nightvision allows him to see in the shadowy light without penalty. He rolls 71 + 48 (skill) - 27 (Arlaina's success) = 92. Partial success means that the new guard has not spotted Arlaina, but gets a sense something is out there. He asks the other guard, "Did you hear something?" With the guards on alert, the GM rules that if Arlaina wishes to continue, her difficulty will increase to a light (+10) Stalking maneuver.

#### Skills as ‘Lores’

Although there is a category of skills called 'Lores' that covers knowledge of particular subjects, any skill can be treated as a 'Lore' skill. This is not treated as a sim -ilar skill, rather the type of information gleaned will be based on the skill used rather than what may be learned from the usual Lore skill. The GM is the ultimate arbi -ter if a non-lore skill can be used to glean information in the given situation.

The type of information gleaned will be completely in the context of the skill being used. Crafting or weapon skills may be used to assess item or weapon quality but not necessarily the local market value. Skill in the Fire Law spell list may be used to evaluate magical fire, or Cooking may be used in place of Region Lore to recall if  the  upper  class  like  or  dislike  broiled  meat  in  this country.

### 3.1. Animal

[Ag+Em] Animal  skills  are  any  skill  that  involves interaction  with  or  control  of  animals  or  beasts.  The maneuver may be an Absolute Maneuver (e.g.,  mak -ing a mount approach a larger beast, training a dog to roll over) or a Percentage Maneuver (most often used for  movement  while  riding),  with  modifiers  given. The difficulty of an Animal maneuver depends on the complexity of the desired maneuver (e.g., trained be -havior,  movement action, or  communication) and the degree to which the animal naturally wants to perform it  (e.g.,  natural  horse  actions  include  walking,  eating, and drinking).

The appropriate animal skill (i.e., Riding while mount -ed and Animal Handling otherwise) is also used in place of  Leadership  for  Fear  Resistance  Rolls  and  rallying frightened animals (Section 14.3).

Table 3-1: Animal Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Your  confidence  breaks  at  a  crucial  moment  and  the  animal seizes the moment to lash out (attacking at +30) before bolting in a random direction.

1 - 75 Failure

Perhaps it  is  your  impatient  manner,  perhaps  it  is  your  overabrupt movements, perhaps your smelly cologne, but the animal is unimpressed and uninfluenced.

UM 66 Unusual Event

The animal recognizes you not as its master but in some other role such as offspring, parent, or mate. Its attempts to protect and feed, follow and imitate, or woo and placate you may be helpful or problematic, depending on the success of your ma -neuver.

76 - 100 Partial Success

For a moment you think the animal is receptive to your guid -ance, but a sudden distraction breaks the moment. You may try again at +10 if appropriate.

101 - 175 Success

Whispering calming words while projecting a sure and confi -dent demeanor, you have the animal's attention and cooperation. Do not waste your opportunity.

176 + Absolute Success

Your insight into this animal's nature has won you its lasting respect. You will receive +30 to any future Animal maneuvers versus this target (until an Absolute Failure is achieved).

animal handling

[Pr] Animal Handling involves the care and feeding of  animals,  as  well  as  training,  minor  healing,  and possibly  simple  communication  depending  on  the type of animal. This can include calming down agi -tated animals, or working them up, herding sheep or guiding a horse, but can be as complicated as teaching the intricate tricks of a circus dog act.

Specializations : Each specific type of animal .

Riding

[Pr] Riding includes the ability to stay on the mount safely  as  well  as  controlling  the  mount.  Characters who lack any riding skill will struggle just to remain seated on an animal when it is moving (an unskilled rider can perform no actions other than perception and conversation while his mount is in motion). The ani -mal will need to be led by someone else, or it will go where it pleases, as the unskilled rider has no control.

Horses are herd animals, however, and if a mounted group is in motion, a horse not being led with an un -skilled rider will follow the 'herd' until spooked or threatened, at which point it will flee (following the group if they all flee, or in the direction away from what scared it if not).

If the mount moves at faster than a walk, an unskilled rider will need to at least partially succeed on a riding maneuver (at the usual -25 penalty for 0 ranks) every round to avoid being thrown.

For  complex  riding  maneuvers  or  controlling  the mount in stressful situations, a riding maneuver is re -quired, with a modifier of half the movement penalty as shown in Table 5-3 in Chapter 5. All other Maneu -vers and actions (like spell casting or attacks) made while riding are subject to the full penalty due to the pace of the mount (Table 5-3), which may be reduced with  the  Mounted  Combat  skill. All  maneuvers  that require the mount to back up are at an additional -20.

Specializations : Each specific type of animal or crea -ture that can be ridden .

### 3.2. Awareness

[In+Re] Awareness  skills  deal  with  noticing,  gath -ering, and interpreting information about one's surroundings.  Awareness  maneuvers  are  most  often Absolute  Maneuvers  resolved  using Table  3-2,  with a difficulty based on how available the information is and how easy or hard it is to interpret.

Table 3-2: Awareness Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

You glean enormous amounts of information about your target… all of it wrong. You utterly misinterpret what you perceive and are sure that you are correct.

1 - 75 Failure

Attempting to emulate the perceptive abilities of an eggplant, you notice nothing useful. There is a great future waiting for you as an art critic.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Your surroundings trigger a flashback to your past and consumes your attention for 3 rounds while you relive the experience. You may immediately make a Lore maneuver to recall something previously  missed  but  important  to  the  story. Your  maneuver resolves after.

76 - 100 Partial Success

Your interest is piqued, but you glean minimal information. You may try again in 6 rounds at a +10, if appropriate.

101 - 175 Success

Following  your  instincts  you  focus  your  attention,  allowing your finely-tuned perception to reveal that which you seek.

176 + Absolute Success

Elementary my dear boy! You identify with casual ease the tar -get or information you seek, along with contextual information not obvious to a lesser eye.

peRception

[SD] Perception is used for noticing details about the environment, and affects how well one interprets the information. It is used to find hidden objects, to notice imperfections in walls that may hide a secret door, to notice  triggers  for  traps,  and  to  sense  potential  am -bushes. Perception includes all the senses, although if a particular sense is required there may be a modifier due to a character's superior (or inferior) sense.

If a character states that he is watching or examining an area, situation, or place, the GM should make an Absolute  Maneuver  roll  using  the  character's  Per -ception skill to determine if the character notices or detects anything. The GM may keep this roll secret, revealing  only  what  the  character  has  observed.  A

<!-- image -->

heavy penalty should be assessed (if a roll is allowed at  all)  in  situations  where  the  players  do  not  know what their characters are looking for or do not spec -ify that their characters are looking for something in particular (likewise, looking for ceiling traps makes it difficult to see pit traps, etc.). Perception is often used as a conflicting skill against other skills like Stalking.

tRacking

[SD] This skill provides a bonus for tracking maneu -vers and is used to read the tracks and signs left be -hind by creatures and to follow a trail left by someone or  something  such  as  footprints,  broken  branches, crushed grass, hanging pieces of cloth, etc. While sim -ilar to Perception, Tracking involves looking for spe -cific details of how beings affect their environment.

A target that is leaving a marked trail is easier to track. The most common cause of an obvious trail is uncon -trolled bleeding (+50 to track a bleeding foe, +100 if the foe is bleeding more than 5 points per round), but GMs will have to use their judgment in other cases.

Example: Borin makes an absolute success using tracking, gleaning a lot of information, as well as direction of movement. 'These tracks were left by two trolls, the larger troll was carrying something on his left side, and the smaller troll has a broken claw on one of its toes. These are the same tracks as the trolls that attacked the farm, and perhaps what's being carried is the missing calf. They went west into the hills.'

Tracking can also be used to obscure your trail. If used this way, apply it as opposed conflicting skill against the follower's Tracking skill. So a result of 120 would make it harder to track you (-20) while a result of 80 would  make  it  easier  to  track  you  (+20).  Covering tracks is more difficult when moving quickly, so pace penalties are x2 when using tracking to conceal your trail while you move.

### 3.3. Battle Expertise

[None] These  skills  are  used  to  reduce  penalties  to attacks and physical maneuvers that are typically em -ployed by heavier armored combatants. While these skills each reduce a penalty to a maneuver, at best they reduce the modification to zero. Battle Expertise skills cannot offer a bonus if the skill exceeds the penalty. However,  if  your  skill  is  less  than  0,  they  will  not make the penalties worse.

maneUveRing in aRmoR

[None] Reduces  the  maneuver  penalty  for  armor worn, but has no effect on the encumbrance penalty for armor worn (Section 7.2).

moUnted combat

[None] Reduces penalties to maneuvers while riding an animal or beast (Section 9.7).

pRotect

[None] Reduces penalties for extending your DB to protect an ally (Section 9.7).

RestRicted QUaRteRs

[None] Reduces penalties when fighting in restricted quarters (Section 9.5).

sUbdUing

[None] Reduces penalties when trying to subdue an opponent (Section 9.7).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 3.4. Body Discipline

[Co+SD] Body Discipline skills  allow  the  character to push their body beyond its normal limits. The use of any Body Discipline skill is an adrenal maneuver. These skills are often of great use to Arms Users, but may not be appropriate for all settings. The use of any Body Discipline skill is an adrenal maneuver.

Table 3-4: Adrenal Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

What were you thinking? Your feeble attempt at focus creates a mental block that hinders your future attempts, giving you a -25 to this skill*.

1 - 75 Failure

You fail to summon the inner focus necessary for this feat, and receive no benefit or effects from your attempt. Thanks for play -ing.

UM 66 Unusual Event

As you begin to summon your focus, you notice an unfamiliar darkness within yourself. You enter a cleansing trance that lasts the entire round. If you succeed at your maneuver treat as an Absolute Success. If you fail, treat as an Absolute Failure.

76 - 100 Partial Success

You are distracted at a critical moment, but receive half the nor -mal benefit. Or, if not in combat, you may abort and try again with a +10. Try switching to decaf.

101 - 175 Success

You are a paragon of self-control and receive full benefits of the maneuver for 1 round for every 20 you succeeded by (1 round for 101-120, 2 for 121-140, etc.), doubled for Adrenal Defense.

176 + Absolute Success

Wow! You not only succeed, but you have tapped into a reser -voir of strength within yourself. As Success, plus you receive double benefits for the first round.

* until an Absolute Success is achieved

Adrenal maneuvers require concentration for 1 round before making an Absolute Maneuver using Table 3-4. The benefits of the maneuver are received the follow -ing round, and will continue for one additional round for every full 20 the maneuver succeeded by (e.g., a total of 1 round on 101-120, 2 rounds on 121-140). On an Absolute Success, the benefit is doubled for the first round. Adrenal Defense is easier to maintain, and the duration is doubled.

One can be under the effects of multiple adrenal ma -neuvers at once, however each one requires a concen -tration  round  to  initiate.  Double  concentration  (Section 8.1) may be used to prepare two adrenal moves in a single round.

The  difficulty  of  an  Adrenal  maneuver  is  based  on how vital it is to the situation and how motivated the character is to succeed. A desperate situation putting a  character's  loved  ones  in  danger  with  adrenaline running high may be an Easy (+20) maneuver, while a casual Adrenal move in a barroom brawl over an insult the character doesn't really care about may be a Very Hard (-20) maneuver.

adRenal defense

[Ag] Adrenal Defense is the complete integration of dodging into fluid natural movements. With a success -ful maneuver the character may perform partial dodg -ing as an instantaneous action (0 AP), or full dodging with concentration. Adrenal Defense is easier to main -tain  than  other  adrenal  maneuvers,  so  the  duration is doubled. On an Absolute Success, double benefits indicates the character may perform full dodging as an instantaneous action during the first round. An Abso -lute Failure means the character is unable to dodge at all the following round (in addition to the table result).

adRenal focUs

[SD] Adrenal Focus can be used to achieve feats of superhuman effort through concentration and self-dis -cipline. With a successful maneuver the character gets a +25 bonus to any Brawn, Gymnastic, or Movement maneuvers (+50 on an Absolute Success).

adRenal speed

[Qu] With a successful maneuver the character gains 2 additional Action Points (4 AP on an Absolute Suc -cess). An Absolute Failure means the character loses his first 2 Action Points the following round (in addi -tion to the table result).

adRenal stRength

[St] With  a  successful  maneuver  the  character's  at -tacks are treated as 1 size larger, and the character's weight is treated as x4 for purposes of feats of strength (2 sizes and x8 on an Absolute Success). There is no effect for a Partial Success, while an Absolute Failure results  in  -1  attack  size  for  the  following  round  (in addition to the table result), and character's weight is treated as 1/4 for purposes of feats of strength.

### 3.5. Brawn

[Co+SD] Brawn skills encompass the physical condi -tioning of one's body. Brawn maneuvers are usually Absolute  Maneuvers,  with  a  difficulty  based  on  the specific skill and scenario.

<!-- image -->

body development

[Co] Body Development covers how well-developed and trained a character's physical body is, with high -er Body Development allowing the character to take damage  without  being  knocked  unconscious  and  to push his body to more extreme levels of exertion or endurance.

The character's Body Development skill bonus is add -ed to his base hits (determined by race) to get his total hits. For Small characters, multiply this total by 0.75. For Big characters, multiply it by 1.5. For characters who are sizes other than Small, Medium, and Big, see Table 9-4a.

The Body Development bonus is also used when mak -ing Endurance rolls (Section 5.5).

A character will die when he reaches negative hits in excess of his Body Development bonus (so a character with +67 body development bonus will die at -68 hits).

foRtitUde

[SD] The character has trained to temporarily block sensations of pain and discomfort, which can be used to  temporarily  reduce  penalties  from  fatigue,  pain, or  injury.  With  a  successful  maneuver  all  penalties due to fatigue, hit loss, injuries, and Stun are halved. Although  the  penalty  for  Stun  may  be  reduced,  the character is still considered Stunned for purposes of attacks against them and for concentration.

A Fortitude maneuver is an instantaneous action. The benefits  of  the  maneuver,  if  successful,  are  received during the same round, and will continue for one addi -tional round for every full 20 the maneuver succeeded by (e.g., a total of 1 round on 101-120, 2 rounds on 121-140).  On  an  Absolute  Success,  no  fatigue,  hit loss, injury, or stun penalties are suffered during the first round. All injury penalties apply to every Forti -tude maneuver, even after successful use of Fortitude.

The Adrenal maneuvers table (Table 3-4) is used for Fortitude maneuvers, and an Absolute Failure results in an additional Fatigue penalty of -20.

Example: Niles is having a rough day. He climbed a cliff to get into the mountain fortress, taking a guard by surprise but not without having a few of his ribs broken. Now a second guard has come around the corner and shot him with a crossbow. Niles has lost enough hits to accrue a -10 penalty, he has a -5 fatigue penalty, his broken ribs are another -15, and he's lightly stunned for one round (-25). It' s times like this that he starts to contemplate teamwork. Well, too late now. Niles tries a Fortitude maneuver. His skill is +79, but he has a total penalty of -55. If he succeeded, the penalties would be reduced to -27 for the round. But a roll of 26 gives him a total of 50, failure. Hopefully the guards will just take him prisoner. Then he can have a nice nap and contemplate sticking with the party next time.

weight-tRaining

[St] Weight-Training  aids  in  using  one's  muscles  to the most advantage with the least chance of becom -ing injured. This covers the proper ways to get a solid grip on objects, the right way to apply strength to lift or move something, and the correct ways to position your body when moving to keep applying force with -out hurting yourself. This skill is used as the bonus for strength-based feats (Section 5.2).

<!-- image -->

### 3.6. Combat Expertise

[None] These  skills  are  used  to  reduce  penalties  to attacks and physical maneuvers that are typically em -ployed  by  more  lightly  armored  combatants.  While these  skills  each  reduce  a  penalty  to  a  maneuver,  at best they reduce the modification to zero. Combat Ex -pertise skills cannot offer a bonus if the skill exceeds the penalty. However, if your skill is less than 0, they will not make the penalties worse.

blind fighting

[None] Reduces  penalties  to  maneuvers  while  blind (or in darkness) or in low light (Section 15.7).

disaRm

[None] Reduces the penalties associated with disarm -ing an opponent (Section 9.7).

footwoRk

[None] Reduces penalties associated with movement while  making  melee  attacks  (including  charging) (Section 8.2).

mUltiple attacks

[None] Reduces  penalties  associated  with  making simultaneous melee attacks in a single round, either against a single foe or multiple opponents (see Katas in Section 9.7).

ReveRse stRike

[None] Reduces the penalty for attacking a target to one's flank or rear, or lowers an opponent's bonuses when attacking your flank or rear (Section 9.5).

### 3.7. Combat Training

[Ag+St] These  skills  cover  training  for  fighting  and defending, whether unarmed or with various types of weapons. The skill bonus in an attack Combat Training skill is referred to as an Offensive Bonus (Section 9.5), while the defensive Shield skill adds to a combatant's Defensive  Bonus  (Section  9.6)  when  used.  Combat Training skills are not subject to difficulty modifiers.

When characters are created, there are 4 different costs for Combat Training, which are assigned to the differ -ent categories listed below. The costs may be assigned in  any  order. All  of  the  skills  below,  except  Shield, have  specializations  (given  in  italics)  which  are  de -tailed in Chapter 7: Weapons &amp; Armor.

melee weapons

[St] Weapons  used  in  hand  to  hand  combat  (broad -sword, spear, war hammer, two-handed sword, etc.). Blade, Chain, Hafted, Greater Blade, Greater Chain, Greater Hafted, Pole Arm, any specific Exotic weapon type

Ranged weapons

[Ag] Muscle  powered  thrown  weapons  as  well  as mechanical devices that fire low velocity projectiles. Bow, Crossbow, Sling, Thrown, Exotic

shield

[St] The shield skill allows a trained combatant to gain more defensive benefit from a shield, either in melee or  against  ranged  attacks  (Section  9.6). This  skill  is also used to make Shield Bash attacks (but Multiple Attacks skill may also be needed to do so while also attacking with a weapon, see Katas in Section 9.7 for details).

UnaRmed

[Ag or St] Unarmed and natural melee attacks (e.g. martial arts, bites). The stat used depends on the spe -cific melee attack (Section 7.1). Strikes [St], Sweeps &amp; Throws [Ag], Wrestling [Ag], Beak [St], Bite [St], Claw [St], Horn [St], Ram [St], Stinger [Ag], Trample [St]

Other Weapon Types

Some campaigns may have elements of science fic -tion or otherwise incorporate unusual weaponry. The categories listed here may be augmented or modified by the GM to account for different types of weapons. A  campaign  may  use  energy  weapons  or  firearms, which would use different stats and require separate training.

In  the  case  where  there  are  more  than  4  Combat Training categories (because some were added), the highest  Combat  Training  category  cost  should  be used  for  all  additional  categories  (e.g.,  assign  the three lowest costs to 3 categories and all other cate -gories will use the fourth cost).

### 3.8. Composition

[Em+In] Composition skills involve the creation of an  original  work  that  conveys  information  and/or emotional  content  in  an  effective  way.  Composition maneuvers could be Absolute maneuvers, using Table 3-8, but could be Percentage maneuvers as well. The difficulty is based on the specifics of the work and the type of response that is desired.

illUsion cRafting

[Pr] The crafting of illusions is a fine art and the work of an artist compels where the efforts of a hack may barely pass as concealment. Illusions are often used to deceive, and Illusion Crafting may be used to ensure verisimilitude or even to imitate real creatures, items, or  individuals.  However,  illusions  may  also  be  used to entertain or to subtly or overtly support other types of performances. A speech may benefit from greater acoustic resonance or timely illumination and shadow, while illusions may cover shabby props and sets on a performing stage.

Table 3-8: Composition Maneuvers

| Roll   | Result           |
|--------|------------------|
| < 1    | Absolute Failure |

You artist types! In a fit of anger you destroy any work you have already accomplished. Your emotions get the better of you and you are -25 to this skill*.

1 - 75 Failure

Whatever is locked in your head remains so. You find yourself utterly unable to transfer your concept to the medium. Perhaps another day will yield improvements.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Your interpretation is a profound departure from your normal style, from any style in fact. People will be unable to understand it and only leave confused. In a few days of contemplation they will see it as either the brilliant (success) or bad (failure) piece that it was.

76 - 100 Partial Success

Your temper flares as your attempts fall short of your expec -tations. While your work has merit, you have not effectively grasped your own intent.

101 - 175 Success

Twas nothing! You have once again demonstrated your ample genius to all  with  the  ability  to  see.  If  only  the  whole  world were not blind compared to you.

176 + Absolute Success

Ahh, Bach! The masterstroke of your piece falls into place with the surety of perfection. This piece will make your reputation, if not your fortune. Who says you have to die to be great?

* until an Absolute Success is achieved

mUsical composition

[Pr] While Musical skill is used to perform a known piece of music, Musical Composition is used to create new works and adapt old ones. A composer may sim -ply be earning a living, but music can also be used to tell stories, to influence the emotions, and to persuade, and  a  catchy  tune  may  spread  farther  than  a  single public speech.

wRiting

[Re] The  written  word  holds  civilization  together. With written  records,  knowledge  can  be  transmitted great distances and preserved over time on scales that far  surpass  what  is  possible  with  an  oral  tradition. Written compositions may be used to inform, to teach, to inspire, or to entertain. A skilled writer may imply rather  than  needing  to  state  outright,  encouraging  a reader to draw the right conclusions, or they may sow confusion and doubt. If the objective is to persuade the reader, Writing may be used in place of the Influence skill.

### 3.9. Crafting

[Ag+Me] This skill covers any attempt to craft a fin -ished product out of raw materials using hand labor. Depending on the type of finished product, this skill may require  simple  or  highly  specialized  tools,  and creating a final product may be a matter of a few min -utes or weeks or months of constant labor.

Crafting skills may be either Absolute Maneuvers, us -ing Table 3-9, or Percentage Maneuvers. The difficulty is based on the state of the materials, tools available, the quality of work, and how much time is being tak -en. For common items, required production times are listed in the equipment tables in Chapter 6.

What crafts are available are dictated by setting and culture, as well as character backgrounds. The play -ers are encouraged to take whatever craft skills make sense  for  their  characters.  For  most  games  where crafting does not play a central role, the GM should not require specializations of the skills. However for games  where  crafting  is  an  important  part,  the  GM may  require  specialization,  for  which  examples  are given in italics.

cUlinaRy

[SD] Food is a big part of any living creatures' lives. Food gets tastier and better for the health if it is pre -pared  with  skill.  Vegetables,  meats  and  beverages each  have  their  own  specialized  crafters  harvesting and preparing the fare for consumption. Cook, brewer, sommelier, butcher, cheese maker

dRawing/painting

[In] Drawing  and  painting  are  used  to  create  visual art  ranging  from  realistic  representations  to  vague abstraction. The artist uses lines, shading, shapes, col -or and texture to create illustrations or pictures. Fine work may require a pencil, pen, paintbrush, or similar tool, but this skill can be crudely performed with any usable surface and nothing else but a pigment of some sort and the character's finger.

Table 3-9: Crafting Maneuvers

| Roll   | Result           |
|--------|------------------|
| < 1    | Absolute Failure |

You fail miserably but are so oblivious you are convinced you have succeeded admirably. Your new misguided approach gives you -25 to this skill*.

1 - 75 Failure

Your skills have deserted you. You waste your effort, and create extra work for yourself. You may attempt to salvage the materi -als with a crafting maneuver with an additional penalty of -25.

UM 66 Unusual Event

You have a great idea for a unique style for your craftwork, and after an arduous effort you realize the work. The result has a unique built-in feature that either hinders the work (if a Failure), or makes it more desirable or useful (if Success).

76 - 100 Partial Success

You know what you want to accomplish, but it just keeps fall -ing short. Your work is functional, but deficient with increased chance of breakage (-10 Strength).

101 - 175 Success

Your hands are sure, and your work is precise and artful. Your work comes out exactly as you intended and there are no sur -prises along the way.

176 + Absolute Success

Your diligence is rewarded with your latest masterwork! Ev -eryone can see the remarkable quality of your work, and your abilities will be more highly regarded than ever. Item has +10 Strength.

fabRic cRaft

[SD] Humans need clothes  to  cope  with  the  weath -er. Cloth is spun from animal or vegetable fibers. To make it  into  clothes  requires  some  decent  work,  al -though many housewives also have some skill in the craft. Spinster, dyer, tailor, weaver, seamstress, tapestry knotter, hatter, rope braider

leatheRcRaft

[SD] Animal hide may be cured and used for all kinds of purposes. It is tough and weather proof and it looks nice.  Many  items  are  made  from  leather. Tanner, leather worker, saddler, cobbler, tent maker, armorer, girdler

metalcRaft

[St] Metals  are  unearthed  and  the  ore  melted  down and refined into ingots or billets. Each metal has its own uses and many specializations exist to make met -al objects. It can be molded or worked. Sample metals include the hard and tough iron, the semi-precious and malleable copper, precious but soft silver and gold and others. Blacksmith, copper smith, foundry worker, jeweler, gold smith, silver smith, weapon smith, armorer

stonecRaft

[St] Stone  is  a  hard  and  resilient  material  used  in building and decoration. It copes well with stationary stresses and it has a beautiful appearance. It is found in hills and mountains and it must be dressed before it  is  used  in  sculptures and buildings. Extracting the best stone and working it to useful form is the task of several specialized professions. Ceramics are an arti -ficially  created  form  of  stone. Mason, stone dresser, sculptor, gem grinder, potter, glazer

woodcRaft

[SD] This material comes from trees. To process this light,  strong,  easily  worked  and  beautiful  material from tree to cupboards and boats requires a plethora of crafters. Wood can be processed to boards, beams and other sizes for more specialized crafters to fashion into usable goods. Sawyer, carpenter, ship wright, cart wright, cooper, bowyer, fletcher

### 3.10. Delving

[Em+In] These  skills  are  used  to  manipulate  the magical energy embedded in objects. Delving is re -solved  as  an Absolute  Maneuver  using  Table  3-10a (attunement) or 3-10b (runes). The difficulty is based on how conducive the environment is to concentration with additional modifiers based on the nature of the magic and the knowledge of the delver. A character is allowed one chance to delve an item. If he fails, he may not try again until he improves his skill rank with the appropriate Delving skill (Attunement or Runes).

Using the rune requires the normal amount of time to cast the spell. Normally, one would attempt to deci -pher the rune in advance, in order to have it identified and useable. This takes three minutes without penalty. To rush the process, one could attempt it in one minute at -10 to the Runes maneuver. Attempting to decipher the rune in a single round would result in a -25 pen -alty. Attempting to decipher the rune simultaneously with casting the spell from it would give a -50 penalty to the Runes roll and a -20 penalty to the casting. It may also prove unhelpful if the stored spell is not what was expected.

attUnement

[Pr] Some  items  require  attunement  prior  to  using some or all of their abilities (as opposed to a magical sword with a +10 OB, where you would normally get the  bonus  even  if  you  were  unaware  of  it). Attune -ment  may  also  be  used  as  a  method  of  identifying items with respect to magical powers. The attunement process involves the formation of a sympathetic bond between the auras of the attuning individual and item. Normally,  only  one  individual  can  be  attuned  to  an item at a time, though an individual may be attuned to any number of items.

The  process  of  attunement  normally  requires  three minutes  to  attempt.  If  the  Attunement  maneuver  is attempted  more  quickly,  it  is  done  at  a  penalty.  For one minute, the penalty is -10. For half a minute, the penalty is -25. Attempting to attune to an item in a sin -gle round is -50. In any case, attunement must occur before the round in which an item is to be used.

Table 3-10a: Attunement Maneuvers

| Roll   | Result           |
|--------|------------------|
| < 1    | Absolute Failure |

You not only fail to attune, you also manage to deattune yourself to any items you have already attuned to. You may attempt to reattune to those items at a -20.

1 - 75 Failure

You fail to match auras with the item, and a period of contem -plation is in order. You may not try again until you have devel -oped another rank of Attunement.

UM 66 Unusual Event

You glimpse a series of visions associated with the item's past over  3  rounds  during  which  time  you  are  in  an  unwakeable trance. When you emerge from the trance you will know about the item's past, even if you've not successfully attuned to it.

76 - 100 Partial Success

You learn one ability of the item, but you cannot use it. You may try again to attune to the item after a good night's sleep.

101 - 175 Success

You learn and may use one ability of the item. You may make a maneuver at +20 to try to gain more knowledge. If you fail you cannot try again for 24 hours.

176 + Absolute Success

You harmonize your aura with that of the item smoothly, learn -ing all abilities of the item, which are now available for your use. If only success looked as impressive as you feel about yourself.

While the process of attunement must be done by the character who will be using the item (if the attunement is to allow use, rather than for identification), a char -acter may aid another character with Attunement by explaining the power(s) and also through the use of the Complementary Skill rule (adding his own ranks in Attunement), although only one such person is al -lowed  to  aid  the  person  attempting  the  attunement. Once the character is attuned to an item, spell abilities may be  used,  making  a  modified  Spell-casting  Roll (SCR),  as  described  in Spell  Law .  Attunement  and the use of magical items is covered in more detail in Treasure Law .

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

You accidentally cast the Rune (targetting yourself) upon trying to decipher it. Learn to read without mumbling to yourself.

1 - 75 Failure

It is all gibberish to you. Until you improve your understanding (develop another rank in Runes), you may not try again.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Yes! Those marks are more than a spell, they contain a secret message! Resolve the maneuver as normal.  It then  takes you 1-10 hours of study (taken at the first opportunity) to conclude that you were mistaken…or were you? (psst, GM…insert plot hook here).

76 - 100 Partial Success

You learn the identity  of  the  spell  inscribed  in  the  Rune,  but cannot use it. You may try again after a good night's sleep, but another Partial Success is treated as Failure.

101 - 175 Success

Your mystical senses are at your beck. You understand the Rune, identify the spell, and may cast it. Life is good when things turn out like this.

176 + Absolute Success

You are a master of the written arts. As Success, but you also notice  any  unusual  features  of  the  Rune  (or  the  material  it  is inscribed on), if any. You will become legendary, as songs are sung of your amazing abilities!

RUnes

[Pr] Using the Rune Mastery or Sacred Runes spell list, spells can be stored in the form of 'runes' for lat -er use by anyone with the skill to do so. These runes are stored in special Rune Paper (or less often, some equivalent) enchanted to hold a rune. Casting a spell from a rune requires a successful Runes maneuver to decipher the rune before casting is attempted.

The level of effect for a rune is the level of the spell inscribed.  This  level  of  effect  may  be  increased  by using a higher-level Rune spell than is necessary for the spell (e.g., a Sleep V spell inscribed using a Rune VI spell would be resisted as a sixth level spell). If the spell is an elemental attack, the reader's appropriate Directed Spell OB is used.

The procedure for casting a spell from a rune is similar to casting a spell normally, except that the spell-caster may add ranks in the Runes skill as well as any ranks in the list from which the spell comes. Other details of the procedure are explained in Spell Law .

Using the rune requires the normal amount of time to cast the spell. Normally, one would attempt to deci -pher the rune in advance, in order to have it identified and useable. This takes three minutes without penalty. To rush the process, one could attempt it in one minute at -10 to the Runes maneuver. Attempting to decipher the rune in a single round would result in a -25 pen -alty. Attempting to decipher the rune simultaneously with casting the spell from it would give a -50 penalty to the Runes roll and a -20 penalty to the casting. It may also prove unhelpful if the stored spell is not what was expected.

### 3.11. Environmental

[In+Me] Environmental skills include skills for sur -viving and navigating in the outdoors.

navigation

[Re] Navigation is used to determine proper directions and distances when using or creating a map in con -junction with some directional aid, such as a compass or the stars. This includes the concept of orienteering, and it is applicable on land or water. Getting around by way of familiar landmarks uses the Region Lore skill instead.

piloting

[Ag] Piloting is the operation  of  a  vehicle such  as  a  wagon,  cart, sleigh,  blimp,  etc.  For animal drawn vehicles, the  driver  should  also have Animal  Handling to  be  able  to  control the animal. Driving in -volves  an  understand -ing of the controls, braking, and perfor -mance  across  various terrain, etc.

The Piloting maneuver may be modified by the speed  of  the  vehicle, the  angle  of  a  turn  (if any),  and  the  approxi -mate  size  and  maneuverability of the vehicle as shown in Table 3-11. Animal powered ve -

hicles are, in general, not particularly maneuverable, and the GM assigned difficulty should reflect as much. For  example,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  right  angle turns with such a vehicle. When the horses turn, the rear of the cart continues moving straight ahead until it is pulled into the curve.

Specializations : Each specific type of vehicle.

sURvival

[Re] Survival includes the skills necessary for living in a specific hostile environment and includes locating potable water, foraging for edible plants, and catching small animals through gathering, fishing and hunting. It also includes the observation and awareness of dan -gerous weather patterns, finding shelter and suitable camp  sites,  starting  fires,  and  improvising  clothing or  equipment. The Urban specialization of this  skill focuses  on  gathering  food  and  other  materials  from people's discards and trash rather than nature, but is otherwise the same.

Specializations : Urban, specific biome (Section 15.1) or  xeno-environment  (different  plane,  alien  world, etc.).

### 3.12. Gymnastic

[Ag+Qu] These skills determine the character's abil -ity to maneuver, contort, or perform stunts, which are graded by difficulty rather than by distance traveled (which would be Movement skills). Gymnastic skills may be resolved as either Absolute Maneuvers (e.g., a backflip using Acrobatics) or as Percentage Maneu -vers (e.g., jumping as far as one can). The maneuver difficulty depends on the complexity of the maneuver.

acRobatics

[St] Acrobatics  includes  tumbling,  horizontal  dives, rolling, swinging on objects, and other general gym -nastic maneuvers. Acrobatics can be used to attempt to control a fall. Any critical suffered due to the fall is increased one severity on an Absolute Failure, de -creased by one severity on a Success, and decreased by two severities on an Absolute Success.

The  difficulty  of  an  Acrobatics  maneuver  is  deter -mined by the amount of movement and the timing of the  maneuver.  Rotations  and  somersaults  make  the maneuver even more difficult.

Table 3-12: Gymnastic Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

In your zeal, you have forgotten to warm up and severely pull a major muscle (-25) and are stunned for two rounds. Good job buddy!

1 - 75 Failure

You freeze at a critical moment, failing your maneuver. If appro -priate, you may make an additional roll to abort your maneuver. Otherwise, take your chances.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Regardless  of  your  success  or  failure,  you  manage  to  make yourself look completely foolish. If no one was watching, you're lucky. Otherwise you will never hear the end of the jokes and stories about it. Surely there's some way to make up for it, or make everyone forget...

76 - 100 Partial Success

Everything was going so well, but you cannot seem to follow through, and it takes longer. If appropriate make an additional maneuver at +10. Otherwise you fail.

101 - 175 Success

Fancy footwork, my friend! You complete the maneuver com -pletely as expected and in fine form, and barely break a sweat. Must be the shoes.

176 + Absolute Success

You skip a light fandango, turn cartwheels 'cross the floor and complete the maneuver with the kind of precision and grace you have always dreamed about. Onlookers gawk as you make the impossible look easy.

contoRtions

[SD] Contortions  is  the  manipulation  of  one's  body in  order  to  move  through  small  openings  or  escape from bonds. The difficulty is based on the size of the opening relative to the character or the material of the bonds and how well they have been secured. This skill can also be used to slip free of grapple attacks, as de -scribed in 'Grapples' in section 9.8.

An attempt to slip out of a grapple or bonds can be made every round, until the character escapes or an absolute failure is rolled, in which case the character has tightened the grapple or bonds to the point where he cannot escape them without assistance. (The char -acter may still attempt to incapacitate a grappling foe or break free of their bonds in a feat of strength.)

Slipping  bonds  is  a  full  4  AP  action  (Section  8.1), while every AP less than 4 imposes a cumulative -25 to the action with a minimum of 1 AP at -75.

Attempting to slip bonds or a grapple without being obvious to someone watching by making small mo -tions imposes a -50 penalty, and allows the character to make a Stalking or Duping conflicting maneuver vs

the observer's Perception to keep their struggles un -noticed (Difficulty level and modifiers based on how closely the observer is watching, light level, and any other modifiers the GM deems appropriate).

jUmping

[St] Jumping  includes  both  running  and  standing jumps.  Every character has a base jump distance de -pending on the type of jump.  Stride is the character's stride modifier, expressed  in inches (e.g., halflings use a stride modifier of -5").

-  Running long base jump = 50" + stride
-  Standing long base jump = (50" + stride) / 2
-  Running high base jump = (50" + stride) / 5
-  Standing high base jump = (50" + stride) / 10

The difficulty modifier to jump a specific distance is +40, minus -20 for each full increment of the charac -ter's applicable base jump distance.

If the maneuver fails, but how far the character actual -ly did jump is important, then consult the Percentage Maneuver table to determine the distance jumped.

Example: Arkose, a goblin (with a stride modifier of -6), has a running long base jump of 44'. He has a bonus of +40 jumping up to 44', +20 up to 88', +0 up to 132', -20 up to 176', etc.

### 3.13. Lore

[Me+Me] Lore  skills  determine  a  character's  effec -tiveness in intellectual pursuits. The number of ranks in an academic skill can be used as a rough guide to determine a character's level of knowledge as shown in  Table  3-13a.  More  typically  the  GM  will  require Lore  maneuvers  to  determine  if  one  can  recall  per -tinent  information.  Lore  maneuvers  can  be  resolved as Absolute Maneuvers using Table 3-13b or as Per -centage Maneuvers to determine how much of a topic someone can recall (or for taking tests!). The difficulty of a Lore maneuver is based on the obscurity and de -tails of the information.

Lore skills represent knowledge of anything gained via experience or from rote learning. This covers knowl -edge of a subject,  but  does  not  necessarily  translate into the deeper understanding provided by a science skill, being merely a collection of anecdotal informa -tion. At the GM's discretion, it is possible that a lore skill,  even  when  a  maneuver  is  made  successfully, may return erroneous or misleading information due to the fact that the source of the lore is in error.

Example: 'All the great cartographers say the western ocean is endless', or 'Holy Gerad said the only way to kill undead permanently was to burn them to ash, then soak the ash in holy water'.

|                   | Table 3-13a: Knowledge Tiers                                                                                           |

| 1 - 5 (Novice)    | Introductory knowledge with details on a few topics.                                                                   |
| 6 - 10 (Student)  | Good understanding and recall of all major topic areas, as well as basic details.                                      |
| 11 - 15 (Scholar) | Mastery and recall of all important aspects of topic, plus many finer details in most areas.                           |
| 16-20 (Expert)    | Ability to form multiple complex inferences, create accurate analogies, and form connections to other subject matters. |
| 21+ (Sage)        | Complete understanding and knowledge of ob- scure and uncommon parts of subject matter.                                |

The Lores described below should not be considered an exhaustive list. The player and GM are encouraged to make use of Lore skills to adequately represent the character's background and knowledge. Depending on the setting and campaign, just about any topic of inter -est could be the focus of a lore skill. However, bear in mind that some topics may be better covered by using applicable skills as Lores as detailed at the beginning of  this  chapter  (e.g.  Survival  skill  for  knowledge  of flora and fauna of a particular biome).

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

What's all this? You irretrievably confuse yourself and cannot possibly recall this information without at least 12 hours to refa -miliarize yourself with the topic.

Hmmm. Nope. Nothing springs to mind. Perhaps if you were to spend another six hours studying the matter…

UM 66 Unusual Event

Great Horny Toads! You've been using that word for years and suddenly realized you were pronouncing it completely wrong! You whoop and gurgle happily, rolling your mouth around the new sound…why is everyone staring at you?

76 - 100 Partial Success

You recall some details of the subject, but nothing specific. Stew on this  for  an  hour  or  so  and  something  might  come  to  you. (Roll again in 1 hour).

101 - 175 Success

Ah, of course! A simple fact, of course, right on the tip of your tongue. You recall all relevant details about the subject.

176 + Absolute Success

With a nonchalant air, you relate the details of the topic from memory, including relevant quotations and analysis by authori -ties of note. Now who's the savant around here?

cReatURe loRe

[Re] Creature  Lore  includes  recognition,  knowledge of habitat and diet as well as any powers and abilities of a specific type of creature. Higher ranks will cover knowledge of any cultures, psychology, and other de -tails. Note that lore regarding normal animals is covered by Survival for an appropriate biome. Creature Lore is appropriate for magical creatures that do not organize themselves into cities or tribes (for those that do, Racial Lore may be more appropriate).

Specializations : Demon, Dragon, Faerie, Undead.

histoRic loRe

[Re] Knowledge of the recorded events of history, the broader the character purchases this lore skill in terms of geography and era the less specific the information will  be,  while  the  narrower  the  era  covered  the  more specific. So the lore skill 'History of the Northern Con -tinent' will apply to many situations, but offer limited, broad  information,  while  'History  of  the  Shulin  Kai during the Third Imperial Era' will offer more specific and detailed information, but only relating to the area and era specified, with limited usefulness covering oth -er periods or adjacent areas. The GM should take into account the fact that history often contains partial truths or falsehoods, so it may require an Absolute Success to recall a detail known to few, while the majority believes the 'story' that is generally held to be true.

langUage

[Re] The ability to communicate with or to understand any language is determined by the language skill. This skill must be specialized as written, spoken, or signaled versions  of  a  language.  Non-spoken  communications including codes, sign language, flag signals, or the like are considered languages for skill purposes.

Table 3-13c indicates the fluency in spoken and written languages  given  the  ranks.  Most  language  skills  are considered  proficient  with  4-6  ranks,  although  some simple languages or codes may only require a few ranks to master (Morse code). Ranks beyond 10 delve into the variations of a language over time or by region. Schol -ars of languages would be able to recognize or recite important speeches or famous written works.

Example: A person with 10 ranks of English and a +50 skill bonus would have knowledge of regional dialects of English from across the globe, but additional ranks may be helpful in understanding something as old as Chaucer.

In  some  situations,  even  when  a  character  has  basic fluency  in  a  language,  stress  or  rushing  may  lead  to confusion  (tense  diplomacy,  fast  talking,  strong  ac -cents,  dialects,  etc.).  The  skill  bonus  may  be  used  to determine if communication is successful, by treating it as a Percentage Maneuver and a difficulty based on the situation. The GM can garble the words to reflect the percentage of success. Each new phrase should be treated the same way, but if someone keeps repeating the same exact words, further PM rolls will add up as normal.

Example: The angry Sindonese customs official pushes his way through the 10 soldiers pointing crossbows at Captain Rolf, and quickly and angrily demands 'Do you have permission to dock at the imperial wharf?!?' The GM has Captain Rolf make a PM in his Sindonese Language skill at Hard, as the official is shouting, moving his head a lot and talking quickly, making it hard to understand. The result is 60%, so considering, the GM tells Captain Rolf 'The angry man in the uniform shouts at you while waving his finger all around at you, the ship and the dock, you think he said 'Do you have letters to deliver at the Dragon's harbor?!?'. Captain Rolf has no idea what the official means and asks 'What…?' Hopefully the official repeats himself.

Specializations : Each written,  spoken  or  signed  language.

Only the most obscure concepts and forms will prove troublesome.                              |

Related languages

Languages develop and change over time, and are influenced by the languages of traders and conquerors. Local dialects develop into languages of their own. When languages are similar, it may not make sense for characters to have to learn each language from scratch. The relationship between two languages may be expressed as a rank penalty. A character who speaks Sindonese may operate at -1 rank in the closely related dialect of South Sindonese, -3 ranks in the separate but historically linked Junho language, and -5 ranks in Ancient Jindon, the root language from which Sindonese and Junho developed. However, even extensive study of Sindonese offers no help when dealing with the unrelated language of Bakandan.

If the character wishes to develop one of these additional languages, they receive the appropriate number of free ranks. For example, a character with native fluency in Sindonese (6 ranks) is considered to already have 3 ranks in Junho, so when they purchase an additional rank it is their 4th.

Developing the relationships between different languages adds a layer of history to a setting, but it also adds complexity and not all GMs will wish to do so. However, it can be helpful in reducing the number of languages characters need to learn in settings with many tongues.

mateRials loRe

[Re] Knowledge of a specific  type  of  material  such as metal includes identification of the raw material, as well as knowledge of sources and methods of working (crafting  uses  the  separate  Crafting  skill).  Materials Lore may also include information on famous magical,  historic,  legendary  or  cursed  types  of  materials and items made from those materials.

Specializations : Bone/horn, Fabrics, Leather, Metal, Stone, Wood.

Racial loRe

[Re] Racial Lore includes recognition, knowledge of habitat and diet as well as any powers and abilities of a specific type of race. Higher ranks will cover knowl -edge of any cultures, psychology, and other details.

Specializations : Elf, Halfling, Human, Orc, etc.

Region loRe

[Re] This skill provides knowledge about the geogra -phy of a region, as well as a basic overview of local cultures, flora, fauna, and a limited history. The region size  may  vary  but  should  be  no  more  than  100,000 square miles (about 300 x 300 miles, roughly the size of the state of Colorado or the nation of Italy).

Religion/philosophy

[Re] This  skill  can  be  taken  generally,  in  which case  it  will  cover  the  basics  of  all  the  religions  and philosophies the character is familiar with, or it can be taken specifically about a single religion, in which case it will offer more specifics and details. This skill will  touch  on  elements  of  history,  but  mostly  relate to points of theory, dogma or belief, along with some details  of  structure  of  organized  religions  or  philo -sophical societies.

Specializations : General, or any single specific religion.

spell loRe

[In] Spell Lore allows a character to recognize spells that have been cast against him, or written spells (rec -ognition  only,  it  cannot  be  used  in  place  of  Runes). This may also provide information on expected dura -tion or area of effect for active spells.

<!-- image -->

### 3.14. Magical Expertise

[None] These  skills  represent  expertise  in  magical spellcasting  and  work  by  reducing  penalties  that would  otherwise  apply.  Magical  Expertise  skills  do not get any stat bonus and only benefit from skill rank bonus, professional bonus, knack, and talents. While Magical Expertise skills can reduce a penalty to the Spellcasting Roll, at best they reduce the modification to zero; they cannot offer a bonus. However, if your skill  is  less  than  0,  they  will  not  make  the  penalties worse. How these skills affect spellcasting is described in Spell Law .

Grace : Reduces penalties for casting spells of a higher level than the caster.

Spell Trickery : Reduces penalties to spellcasting due to  attempts  to  hide  or  modify  its  visual  effect  (if  the visual spells optional rule is used) or hand and voice usage. This skill must be specialized in a specific list.

Transcendence :  Reduces  the  spell-casting  penalties associated with armor.

### 3.15. Medical

[In+Me] Medical skills include healing and treating injuries, as well as applications of active compounds (either with healing or poisonous properties). The GM should decide what kinds of medical skills are avail -able based on the tech level and knowledge base of the setting. Difficulty varies depending on the specific skill.

Table 3-15: Medical Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

The herb is  not  only  ruined,  it  has  become  slightly  toxic.  If treating a patient, you manage to make things worse, increasing any injury penalty by -10.

1 - 75 Failure

The herb or poison and your pride are ruined. If treating a pa -tient, the Recovery Roll is made at -100 (as if they received no care).

UM 66 Unusual Event

Your preparation of the herb or poison has altered its properties in a way that may be useful (on a Success) or not (on a Failure). If treating a patient, in addition to success or failure treating the condition, you've improved or worsened a different condition by +/-10.

76 - 100 Partial Success

The herb or poison is half as potent. If treating a patient, your misguided care provides minimal improvement. The Recovery Roll is made at a modifier of -25.

101 - 175 Success

The herb or poison is ready! If treating a patient, you are alert enough to catch problems as they arise and they should recover normally (+0 to the Recovery Roll).

176 + Absolute Success

The herb or poison has doubled potency. If treating a patient, you know exactly what to do and they respond miraculously to your care (add +25 to the Recovery Roll).

heRbalism

[Re] Herbalism  includes  knowledge  of  effects  and doses, preparation, and application of herbs and med -icines. Searching for herbs should use Survival skill for  the  appropriate  biome,  although  Herbalism  may be used as a Complementary skill. Detailed rules on herbs appear in Treasure Law . In higher tech societies, this skill could be replaced with Pharmacology.

medicine

[Re] This skill provides a bonus for treating injuries and overt symptoms of illness. This skill includes the use of simple medical aids/herbs, setting broken bones, stopping bleeding, etc. For detailed use of this skill see the rules on injuries and healing (Section 13.1).

poison masteRy

[Re] Poison  Mastery  includes  knowledge  of  effects and doses, preparation and application of health-de -stroying chemicals or diseases. This skill also covers the preparation and application of antidotes to those toxins.

### 3.16. Mental Discipline

[Pr+SD] Mental  Discipline  allows  the  character  to push his mind beyond its normal limits and achieve extreme states of focus. Difficulty depends on the spe -cific skill.

contRol lycanthRopy

[SD] The  infectious  shape  changing  inflicted  by  ly -canthropy  is  provoked  by  instinct  and  emotion  and controlled through discipline and calm. The emotional urge to give in to the inner animal rises and falls with the lunar cycle, being hardest to resist at the full moon.

-  Full (-50)
-  Waxing Gibbous (-30)
-  Waning Gibbous (-20)
-  Waxing Quarter (-10)
-  Waning Quarter (0)
-  Waxing Crescent (+10)
-  Waning Crescent (+20)
-  New Moon (+30)

Each time the character goes to sleep on a full moon, any time the player (or GM) has the character display -ing real rage, and any time the GM feels the character is  being  put  under  extreme emotional stress, an Ab -solute  Maneuver  should  be  rolled  against  this  skill (at  -25  if  0  ranks)  to  see  if  the  character  transforms into his bestial form. If this happens, the lycanthrope (under the control of the GM) will hunt, kill and feed, violently  attacking  anyone  who  interferes.  Once  its hunger is sated, it will find a place to hide and sleep. During this sleep, it will transform back into 'human' form and awaken back in control of himself with no memory of the transformation or what he did while in bestial form.

A  lycanthrope  can  attempt  to  change  into  bestial form  while  maintaining  control  at  an  additional  -25 to the maneuver, and transform from controlled beast to 'human' form at an additional -50 to the maneu -ver. Failure at either type of change will result in the lycanthrope  slipping  into  uncontrolled  state  per  the paragraph above.

Physical stress and trauma (injury and fatigue penal -ties) make it harder to control lycanthropy and should

Table 3-16: Mental Discipline Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

You  are  assailed  by  doubts  and  distractions.  Your  feeble  attempt at focus creates a mental block that hinders your future attempts, giving you a -25 to this skill*.

1 - 75 Failure

You call forth your discipline and… what was that noise? Sor -ry,  trying  to  focus  here.  Why  won't  that  itch  go  away? Your effort is insufficient to get past the distractions.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Carefully  you  follow  the  path  of  a  thought  before  realizing it is seemingly unrelated to your task. If you succeed at your maneuver, the unexpected insight is treated as an Absolute Suc -cess. If you fail, it has led you far astray to an Absolute Failure.

76 - 100 Partial Success

Your discipline is assailed by distractions and you find it dif -ficult to focus. You receive half the usual benefit, or may try again next round with a +10 modification.

101 - 175 Success

Summoning all your training, you concentrate on your breath -ing and empty your mind, permitting yourself to focus com -pletely on the task at hand.

176 + Absolute Success

You slip easily into a state of perfect focus, easily putting aside all distractions and doubts. You receive x2 normal benefits and a +10 on subsequent rolls to maintain this state.

* until an Absolute Success is achieved be  applied  as  penalties  to  the  maneuver;  it  is  up  to the  GM  to  assess  any  mental  or  emotional  stresses that may be worthy of penalties as well. Meditation, sedative herbs or drugs, or magical effects that give bonuses to calm or self-discipline can all give bonuses to control checks of this skill.

meditation

[SD] Meditation  can  be  used  to  enter  and  exploit a  mental  trance  which  the  character  can  use  to  help solve  difficult  problems  or  perform  mental  maneu -vers. To use this skill, the character must meditate for 5 minutes. With a successful maneuver the character gets a +25 the following round to all mental actions (attuning  to  a  magical  item,  casting  a  spell,  using  a lore skill, etc.).

mental focUs

[SD] Mental Focus is used to maintain concentration for  extended  periods  of  time  (Section  5.5),  while stunned, or when concentrating on two things at once (Section 8.1). A GM may also require a Mental Focus roll in extremely stressful, chaotic, or confusing situ -ations.

### 3.17. Movement

[Ag+St] These  skills  determine  a  character's  ability to travel distances in stressful situations using the Per -centage  Maneuver  table.  Maneuvers  are  not  needed for routine, non-stressful activities. There is no need to make a Running maneuver every time a character walks across a room.

Many movement skills require effort just to 'hold-on', such  as  treading  water,  flying,  climbing,  or  tight -rope-walking,  and  as  such,  require  Concentration whenever the character is  trying  to  perform  another action. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may require a maneuver roll to prevent falling or drowning. If a character has the right equipment, he can create situations in which he can pause these kinds of motion and  then  act  without  concentrating  (e.g.,  wearing  a flotation vest when swimming or tying yourself to a spike nailed into a wall when climbing).

climbing

[Co] Climbing  includes  maneuvers  from  climbing a  ladder  to  scaling  a  cliff.  Climbing  speed  is  1/4  of the character's normal Base Movement Rate (BMR). This base rate is adjusted by pace as normal. However, climbing faster than a 'Jog' (x2) is not allowed unless there are plenty of obvious hand and footholds (such as a ladder or tree), or if the character has claws or is otherwise physically specialized for climbing move -ment.

flying

[Co] As  with  other  Movement  skills,  the  speed  of flight depends on a base movement rate (usually de -fined according to the means of flight) and a selected pace.  However,  while  flying,  a  Sprint  is  'Diving' pace, a speed achievable only by rapidly descending, and Dash is 'Power Diving' pace, a speed achievable only by flying as hard as possible while rapidly de -scending. Flying creatures can glide at up to a running pace at half the normal movement penalties. Unless the conditions are ideal, in the form of strong thermals or updrafts, every round of continued gliding will re -quire a successful maneuver at a cumulative -10 per round.

RUnning

[Co] The main movement skill for ground-based rac -es, Running is the skill used for moving at any pace (Creep through Dash) on foot. It includes all ground movement regardless  of  speed,  and  is  also  used  for evasive dodging on foot (see Section 9.6), although in some cases Acrobatics may be used in its place.

swimming

[Co] For non-native swimmers, the Base Movement Rate of swimming maneuvers is 1/4 of the character's normal BMR, which is adjusted by pace as normal. Armor  and  encumbering  equipment  are  especially detrimental in water and as such any Armor or Encum -brance penalties are multiplied by 3 (before the Battle Expertise:  Maneuvering  in  Armor  skill  is  applied) while swimming.

### 3.18. Performance Art

[Em+Pr] Performance  Art  skills  include  those  that that  involve  a  performance,  often  intended  to  evoke an emotional response or tell a story. Performance Art skills  are  almost  always  Absolute  Maneuvers.  The skills listed here are only the most basic, others may be added depending on the setting.

acting

[Me] Acting is the skill of feigning emotions, as well as using both voice and body language to create a per -sona (either an original or mimicry of someone else). It also includes some ability to interpret a text or per -formance in terms of character motivations.

mUsic

[Me] The Music skill includes the actual performance of playing music (sheet music or improvisation) on a specific instrument or singing.

Specializations : Singing, Each group of instruments (drums, flutes, woodwinds, horns).

Table 3-18: Performance Art Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Horrors!  In  what  is  most  certainly  the  worst  performance  of your career, you manage to offend everyone in your audience, giving you -25 to this skill*.

1 - 75 Failure

A lackluster performance leaves your audience yawning. The snores drown out the feeble applause. Maybe you should join the circus.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Unbeknownst to you, two rival factions were in the audience and you have given offense to one of them. You find yourself embroiled in their raging dispute overshadowing how your per -formance actually was. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.

76 - 100 Partial Success

Not bad. Not good, but not bad. You hold the attention of the audience, but a few key blunders spoil an otherwise satisfactory performance.

101 - 175 Success

Bravo! Your performance is a success, and the enthusiastic re -sponse of your audience warms your old performer's heart.

176 + Absolute Success

You have surpassed yourself, and your audience mobs you for autographs,  bits  of  string  from  your  outfit,  and  kisses.  What will you do for an encore? It is best to not keep your audience waiting.

* until an Absolute Success is achieved

stage magic

[Ag] Stage  magic  is  the  act  of  performing  carefully choreographed  tricks,  usually  using  props.  This  in -cludes small-scale magic such as card tricks and largescale tricks such as 'cutting' a person in half.

### 3.19. Power Manipulation

[Realm+Realm] Power  Manipulation  skills  involve manipulating,  storing,  and  transmitting  raw  magical energy directly,  rather  than  using  it  for  spellcasting. The manipulation of magical energy can be turned to many purposes, each of which is handled in its own way, as described in the skill descriptions below. The GM  may  impose  a  difficulty  modifier  for  unusual situations or environments, though it will usually be Medium (0).

channeling

[SD] This skill can be used to transmit Power Points from one person to a willing target, or to an item made to  store  power. The sender must know the exact lo -cation  of  the  target,  either  by  seeing  him,  via  some magical means, or by prearranged appointment (e.g., 'Stand in front of the altar of the moon at exactly mid -night, and I will send the power to you.').

To transmit Power Points the character must declare how many points he is sending, then make a Medium (+0) Percentage Maneuver with modifiers according to Table 3-19a. The resulting number is the percentage of  Power  Points  that  were  successfully  transmitted (the rest are wasted). Any result over 100 is treated as a bonus to the recipient's roll. A negative result will drain an equal amount of Power Points from the send -er beyond the total loss of the points they attempted to  transmit (down to 0, any loss beyond that can be ignored).

To receive Power Points, the recipient also makes a Medium (0) Percentage Maneuver, but without any of the modifiers from Table 3-19a. A numbered result is the percentage of the transmitted Power Points actu -ally gained (maximum of 100% of the Power Points sent). This can allow the recipient to end up with more Power Points than he normally has; however, he will lose 1 PP every hour until the remaining amount is no more than his normal maximum.

| Table 3-19a: Channeling Modifiers      | Table 3-19a: Channeling Modifiers   |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Scenario                               | Modifier                            |
| Touching recipient                     | +10                                 |
| Recipient over 100' away               | -20                                 |
| Cannot see recipient                   | -50                                 |
| Sender &recipient use different realms | -100                                |

diRected spell

[Ag] Directed spells are types of magical attacks that are  directed  or  aimed  at  a  target  (Section  9.2).  This skill  provides  the  offensive  bonus  (OB)  for  such  at -tacks, but does not create the attack itself, which must be created by casting an applicable spell.

Specializations : Elemental Bolts, Illusionary Attacks, Hurling.

poweR development

[Co] The total bonus for this skill determines the num -ber of Power Points that a character will have avail -able for spell casting. Each character has a single pool of Power Points (PP), even if that character has access to multiple realms.

Power Points are recovered through rest. For each 2 hours of sleep the character will regain 10% of their Power Point total,  for  up  to  a  full  night  of  sleep  (8 hours per day). Characters who require more or less sleep will recover Power Points proportionally faster or slower but only to the limit of a full night. For ex -ample, a character who only requires 4 hours of sleep per night will recover 10% per hour but only up to the limit  of  4  hours. The  rate  of  recovery  may  vary  ac -cording to the campaign's Power Level (Section 12.1). A fully rested caster has considerable power available, but if they expend that power completely it will take more than a night before they have recovered.

poweR pRojection

[SD] A form of magical dueling, Power Projection is used between two opponents. Its use creates a visible construct  of  magical  energy  between  the  opponents (e.g., a ball of power or a strand of light connecting the two) that is held up until one of the participants fails.

The opponents, who must be within 30' of each other, enter  into  combat  rounds  and  must  immediately  begin rolling initiative each round. Each participant on their initiative must expend 1 PP each round and make a  Routine  Absolute  Maneuver  using  this  skill  each round, resolved using Table 3-19b. Neither participant may perform any action other than conversation and casual perception while engaged in a Power Projec -tion duel. Starting with the second round, the maneu -ver is subject to a cumulative -20 each round it is held active. If one of the participants cannot (running out of PP) or will not (unwilling) contribute any additional PP, moves out of 30' or is stunned, treat that as a fail -ure result on Table 3-19b. As soon as one participant loses control of the projection by any of the criteria above, or from failing a check, and the penalties of

failure have been resolved, treat the contest as com -pleted. The other participant in the power projection duel has won, and is untouched and unharmed by the effects of the loser's failure without needing to make any additional rolls.

Table 3-19b: Power Projection Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Your reach has exceeded your grasp. Treat as a Failure and addi -tionally roll on the Spell Failure Table 'Force' column and add the number of hits taken.

1 - 75 Failure

You have lost this projection, which bruises your body as well as your ego. Take Hits equal to both sides' PP total in the pro -jection.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Your projection inadvertently creates a magical vacuum, which flares up briefly and sucks additional power from both partici -pants. Each participant must immediately expend another 1 PP, which is added to the projection pool.

76 - 100 Partial Success

You almost lose your hold on the projection, but may recover if you immediately contribute an additional PP this round.

101 - 175 Success

Only a slight squint of concentration betrays the effort involved in keeping up the projection, and you keep control this round.

176 + Absolute Success

The ease with which you control the projection surprises even you. You do not need to contribute any PP the following round in order to continue. Are you wearing a pointy hat?

### 3.20. Science

[Me+Re] Science skills are similar to Lore skills but include  the  application  and  analysis  of  information to  solve  problems  and  make  predictions.  Sciences include a theoretical framework allowing one to not only recall facts and make simple inferences of known cases, but to develop hypotheses regarding unknown areas of the field. The GM may choose not to allow some science skills to be taken, based on the techno -logical level of the game world.

Example: Astronomical Lore could identify known constellations, planets, stars, etc. Someone with Astronomy could predict their movements (with a precision varying based on technological level).

aRchitectURe

[Re] Architecture is the science of building construc -tion,  a  specialized  engineering  skill  that  includes some  artistic  training  as  well.  Someone  with  basic Crafting skills may build a cabin like other cabins he has known, but to plan out a large and/or complicated structure that will endure, or an effective new design, requires  an  architect.  Large-scale  traps  and  mecha -nisms like elevators built into a structure are also part of architecture.

astRonomy

[Re] The oldest physical science to be well developed, and a driving force in the development of mathemat -ics,  astronomy  includes  not  only  identification  of various  celestial  objects,  but  the  prediction  of  their movements. Depending on the setting, it may include varying degrees of understanding of what those bodies actually are (and their true nature in the setting may differ from their nature in reality).

engineeRing

[Re] Engineering  combines  aspects  of  mathematics, physics and invention. It provides a theoretical knowl -edge of devices and processes, and an understanding of why things work. Characters may use Engineering to determine what a device does, design new devices or streamline systems.

In  more  advanced  cultures  the  GM  may  require  the skill be specialized, however in a fantasy setting this is not needed (essentially this is basic mechanical and hydraulic engineering).

Table 3-20: Science Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Pitiful. You not only fail to produce accurate results, you pro -duce wrong results. You cannot discover where you made your mistake and get -25 to this skill*.

1 - 75 Failure

You fail to grasp the problem and any time you have spent is wasted. You may not attempt again until you have reflected on this and 24 hours have passed.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Good heavens! In the course of your analysis, you have stum -bled  across  a  hitherto  unrealized  theorem!  Abandoning  your current task for several minutes you follow this line of reasoning instead of your original task. The world must be told of your revelation!

76 - 100 Partial Success

Persistence yields results. So persist. You may try the maneuver again (requiring the normal time) and get +10 to the roll.

101 - 175 Success

You have blinded them with science! You have arrived at what you are sure is the right answer. Pretty sure. No, it's right. Al -most certainly right.

176 + Absolute Success

Brilliant!  Your  seldom-appreciated  genius  rises  to  heretofore unseen levels. In half the time normally required, you manage to hold a command of the material that gives +10 on your next analysis.

* until an Absolute Success is achieved

mathematics

[Re] In  the  simplest  form,  mathematics  involves counting and the basic operations of addition, subtrac -tion,  multiplication and division. At higher levels of difficulty, it can be used to measure and account for more and more facets of tangible things. Higher levels of  difficulty  allow  for  more  complicated  manipula -tions, and the manipulation of more abstract qualities and quantities. The application of many other sciences will  depend on adequate mathematical skill to carry out the necessary calculations.

### 3.21. Social

[Em+In] Social skills include any that involve interac -tion with other people. While most of these tend to be Absolute Maneuvers, some skills have specific rules. The difficulty depends on what is being attempted and the receptiveness of the target. Additional information is provided in Chapter 14: Psychology.

Table 3-21: Influence Maneuvers

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Your  clumsy  attempts  at  manipulation  are  transparent  to  all, including the target who reacts accordingly. Future attempts to influence this target automatically fail*.

1 - 75 Failure

You fail to influence your target in the least. Your target may make a Social Awareness maneuver to note your attempt.

UM 66 Unusual Event

Your slick manner and glib tongue are utterly fascinating to your target.  With  Success,  he  will  become  your  biggest  fan  to  the point of annoyance. With Failure, he names you his arch-nem -esis. Either way you will really need to get rid of this person.

76 - 100 Partial Success

You were doing great until you got impatient. You cut to the chase too soon, and your target is wary. If appropriate, roll again next round with a -10.

101 - 175 Success

Oh ye of the silver  tongue! You  smooth-talk  your  target  into tractability, and get the desired result.

176 + Absolute Success

You must have been an incubus in a former life. In any case, you have your target wrapped around your little finger and receive +30 to any future Influence attempts versus this target (until an Absolute Failure is achieved).

* until an Absolute Success is achieved

inflUence

[Pr] This  skill  provides  a  bonus  to  maneuvers  that attempt  to  shift  people's  opinions  in  a  direction  the character desires.

Specializations : Charm, Duping, Intimidation.

Charm : This skill involves knowing how to approach and interact  with  people  so  that  they  like  you  more and  are  willing  to  do  you  'favors'.  The  more  time and effort that you put into laying ground for a charm maneuver, the more effectively it works. Charming is getting something for nothing, the moment you move over into 'I'll do you a favor, if you do me a favor' you are using Trading and not Charm.

Duping : This skill covers knowing how to lie, bluff, dissemble or spin the truth convincingly.

<!-- image -->

Intimidation : This skill covers being able to get what you want out of people by subtle or overt threat, with -out taking it so far as to make them flee for help or fight  back  (and  without  provoking  a  fear  or  morale reaction). It may also be used to deliberately provoke a fear or morale reaction, in which case the number of ranks is used as the attack level for the recipient's fear RR (see Section 14.2 and 14.3 for details).

leadeRship

[Pr] Leadership is used to inspire those loyal to you to follow your instructions or to effectively organize a group. This skill cannot be used on those not already loyal to you, but for those who view you as their lead -er, this skill can be used to rally or inspire them. Any instruction or command given that might be resisted or questioned (i.e., one that requires a morale check; see Section 14.3) is modified by your Leadership bonus. Also,  all  combatants  who  consider  you  their  leader get a bonus equal to your ranks in leadership to any RRs vs. Fear/Terror as long as they are aware that you are present. The leader may also make a maneuver to rally followers affected by a failed fear check (Section 14.3).

Leadership also provides a benefit when coordinating multiple  individuals  in  a  task.  See  Complementary Skills at the beginning of this chapter for details.

social awaReness

[Em] This skill develops awareness of the motives and social maneuvers of those around you. You can make maneuvers using this skill to study other people and try  to  understand  them,  determine  if  they  are  lying, or otherwise infer their motives. If someone is using this skill (i.e., not relaxed with his guard down) when targeted with an Influence skill maneuver (see above) then he can make a conflicting maneuver to notice the Influence attempt.

tRading

[Pr] Trading is used to negotiate, haggle, and strike bargains. Characters who are good at this skill will be able to figure out a deal that works for both parties, if a deal is possible. In some cases this may be resolved as an opposed Absolute Maneuver. For haggling, resolve as an opposed Percentage Maneuver with the buyer as the active party. The final price is 200% - result, giving a price from 50% to 200%.

The difficulty is based on how the deal the player is of -fering would look to the target. If the deal seems safe and very favorable for the target it should be easy to convince him, while if the deal seems to shortchange the  target  or  put  him  in  trouble  or  danger  it  will  be more difficult, or perhaps impossible.

### 3.22. Spellcasting

[Realm+Realm] Spellcasting includes all types of informal (magical rituals) and formal (spell lists) magic. Unlike  most  other  categories,  the  spellcasting  skills have different costs.

magical RitUal

[Me] Magic Rituals are an alternative way to use mag -ic (See Spell Law , Chapter 5). As compared to spells, rituals may be broad in effect but usually take much longer to use. The examples included in the category listing  below  are  representative,  not  comprehensive. While  most  spell  effects  will  fall  into  one  category or another, some will fall into two types. For exam -ple, the Shield spell, while clearly a defensive spell, functions by creating a temporary barrier object. Thus, either a Creation or Defensive ritual would be suitable for producing a Shield.

Specializations : each type of ritual.

Alteration : Rituals of Alteration deal in changing the appearance, form, nature, or substance of a physical or spiritual thing. This includes shape-changing, Glamours , and mental influence. It does not include any act of creation, destruction, or restoration.

Creation :  Rituals of Creation deal in the production of permanent or temporary things. It does not apply to things that are only momentary, such as a Fire Bolt or similar elemental attacks. This category includes Wall spells, illusions and phantasms, the Creations list, and Symbols .

Defensive :  Defensive  Rituals  deal  with  powers  of avoidance,  deflection,  or  resistance  of  harm.  They include spells granting defensive (RR, DB) bonuses, spells providing improved Armor Type, and spells that block attacks.

Destruction :  Rituals  of  Destruction  deal  in  direct destruction.  They  include  most  Sorcerer  spells,  dis -pelling, and Repel Undead spells. They do not include spells that create elemental material which then causes damage,  only  magic  effects  that  directly  damage  or disrupt the target.

Elemental : Elemental Rituals are those that deal with the six elemental types known to the Magician: Earth, Fire, Ice, Light, Water, and Wind, as well as the more general 'elemental' powers of weather generally.

Healing :  Healing  Rituals  deal  in  powers  of  resto -ration. Most commonly, these will involve the healing of broken bodies, but this category of ritual includes the mending of broken minds and spirits, the mending of the sundered bond between body and soul (and thus Lifegiving ),  and the mending of damaged non-living objects.

Informational :  Informational  Rituals  deal  with  in -formation, either gathering it or transmitting it. This includes  sense  augmentation  (e.g., Nightvision ),  de -tections,  divination,  delving,  analyses,  and  spells  of communication.

Summoning  &amp;  Transportation :  These  rituals  deal with movement, be it at a slow pace or instant trans -ference.  This  includes  inter-dimensional  movement and so covers the summoning of demons and others not native to the mortal world. Spells allowing one to fly or walk on ceilings, spells of creature summoning, and teleportation effects all fall within this category.

spell lists - base, open, closed, aRcane, RestRicted

[Me] Developing a spell list gives a character the abil -ity to cast spells from that list. The number of ranks a character has in a list determines the level to which he can cast from that list (e.g., if a character has 8 ranks in Fire Law he can cast any spell from the Fire Law list up to 8th level). The number of ranks in the spell list plus the caster's realm stat bonus (once) is also added to the Spellcasting Roll when a spell is cast. The full skill bonus in a Spell List is used for Spell Mastery: at -tempts to change the spell when it is cast (e.g., making a Fire Ball diameter smaller or shaping a Wall of Fire ). Other uses are occasionally specified in certain spells.

There  are  5  different  Spell  List  skills:  Base,  Open, Closed, Arcane, and Restricted, with each individual spell list as specializations. Base lists are the special -ized spell lists of each magic-using profession. Open lists are common, relatively straightforward spells that may be understood by anyone using the realm. Closed lists represent more esoteric magical techniques which may be understood by any user of the realm, but with greater difficulty. Arcane lists are more obscure or ex -otic  magics  which exist  outside  of  the  three  realms. Restricted lists include any list the GM allows you to learn  which  is  not  a  Base,  Open,  Closed,  or Arcane list (e.g., the Base list of another profession). You may not develop ranks in lists from realms other than your own.

Specializations : Each Base, Open, Closed, Arcane, or Restricted Spell List.

### 3.23. Subterfuge

[Ag+SD] Subterfuge skills deal with avoiding detec -tion  and  making  maneuvers  without  being  noticed. The difficulty depends on the specific skill.

<!-- image -->

ambUsh

[In] Ambush is the ability to make a very precise at -tack and can only occur when the opponent is com -pletely  unaware  of  the  character's  attack.  In  such  a situation,  the  ambushing  character  makes  an  attack roll as normal (with a bonus for surprise and frequent -ly for a rear or flank attack). If a critical is obtained, the character may modify his roll on the appropriate Critical Strike Table. The roll can be adjusted up or down by any number up to the character's ranks in the Ambush skill. A separate Ambush maneuver is not required. Ambush may be used against a foe already in a melee situation if the foe is unaware of the attack, but  because  position  is  relatively  unpredictable  in  a general melee situation, Ambush skill rank is halved in this case.

ROLEMASTER

z

Character Law

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

If  the  target  is  killed  or  knocked  unconscious  from the attack, the Ambush skill can also be used to make the attack silent. An Absolute Maneuver roll is made and  if  successful  then  the  attack  and  target  do  not make any noise (unless the GM determines the type of  attack  cannot  be  made  silently). The  difficulty  of the maneuver should be based on how loud the attack made is, and how close any observers are.

Specializations : each  Combat  Training  skill  (e.g., Melee, Ranged), or a Directed Spells specialization.

concealment

[In] Concealment is the skill to hide items or groups of items of any size (e.g., building, campsite), or even people  using  the  environment,  taking  advantage  of lighting, and using camouflage where appropriate. For an individual character trying to remain unseen either moving or stationary, use the Stalking skill.

stalking

[In] Stalking is the ability to move in silence and un -seen, using camouflage and shadows to conceal your presence.  The  difficulty  of  the  maneuver  using  this skill is determined mainly by the surroundings. It will be easier in a dark, shadowy area with a lot of cover, but more difficult in brightly lit areas without cover. Similarly, moving across a smooth surface with lots of ambient noise makes it easier to not be heard. Stalking is opposed by Perception skill.

tRickeRy

[In] Practitioners of this skill have trained their hands in the art of misdirection to perform acts that may al -most seem magical to the untrained eye, but are not. Trickery includes any sleight of hand such as might be used in cheating at cards or other games of chance, or picking pockets.

### 3.24. Technical

[In+Re] Technical skills cover the knowledge, design, use and maintenance of mechanical devices (construc -tion and major repairs require an appropriate crafting skill). Some devices may require tools in order to use, activate, or deactivate. Technical maneuvers are most often Absolute Maneuvers, with a difficulty based on the  complexity  of  the  device.  The  complexity  com -bines the sophistication of the device with the diffi -culty  in  unlocking/disarming/using  it. A  device  may be relatively simple in construction yet be extremely difficult to unlock, disarm, or operate.

locks

[Ag] This  skill  includes  manipulating  and  picking locks without a key, maintaining locks, changing us -er-adjustable locks, and the design of locks (actually manufacturing  a  lock  would  require  an  appropriate Crafting skill). Some suggested difficulties for locks: simple shackle lock (Easy), Combination or tumbler lock (Hard to Extremely Hard), Double key tumbler/ dual combination lock (Sheer Folly). Special tools or circumstances may further modify the complexity. For instance, a lock made of special materials, a broken, jammed or seized lock, or any other circumstance be -yond normal may increase or decrease the difficulty of a given task.

mechanics

[Me] This skill relates to the operation or repair and construction of technology. In most fantasy environ -ments, mechanics will be a singular skill covering all possible  mechanical and hydraulic (pumps) devices. At higher tech levels, this skill should become more and more specialized.

Operation covers the proper use of technological con -structs,  getting  the  maximum possible results out of them, and avoiding overstressing them to the point of breakage. Mechanics can be used to operate parts of a vehicle as long as it is not in motion, but in motion the vehicle will require the Piloting skill.

Repair &amp; Construction allows a character to assemble technological constructs from parts or to identify jams or  replace  damaged  parts.  Construction  or  repair  of broken parts requires an appropriate crafting skill, and crafting new, original devices requires the Engineer -ing (Science category) skill.

Operation, Repair &amp; Construction.

tRaps

[Ag] This skill is used for setting up, maintaining, or disarming devices intended either to harm or capture the  creature  who  sets  it  off,  or  to  set  off  an  alarm. Some suggested difficulties for traps: snare trap, bells on a string alarm (Easy), tripwire (Medium), pressure plate  (Hard  to  Extremely  Hard),  vibration,  air  pres -sure, magical or light triggers (Sheer Folly or harder). Special tools or circumstances may further modify the complexity.  For  instance,  a  trap  with  extra  triggers designed to set it off if tampered with, well concealed or covered parts, or extra useless parts to make it more confusing could all increase the difficulty of disarming the trap.

This  skill  can  also  be  used  on  a  discovered  trap  to assess it, and figure out ways to avoid it without dis -arming it (e.g., 'The pressure plates take 100 pounds of pressure to trigger the trap, so if we lie down and drag ourselves across the floor we shouldn't set them off'). This may be more or less difficult than disarming the trap, depending on the specifics of the triggering mechanism.

### 3.25. Vocation

[Em+Me] Every  occupation  includes  a  lot  of  small skills  that  are  not  covered  by  any  other  skill  in  this list. A sailor may know how to tie knots, a valet may know exactly the  right  clothing  to  wear  to  a  winter ball,  a  soldier  knows  whom  and  how  to  salute,  an office worker knows how to type, etc. A specific oc -cupation or field must be specified when ranks in this skill are developed, and any actions that the player can justify,  and  the  GM accepts, may be attempted with this skill. V ocation is intended as a general catch-all for the multitude of minor skills that someone in an occupation would know. It is not intended to replace several other skills with a single skill! V ocation is also useful when impersonating or persuading a member of a given occupation.

administRation

[Re] This skill includes vocations that deal with man -aging,  administration,  and  organizing.  It  covers  the procedures  and  practices  of  the  vocation,  and  may be used both to manage records and to make use of those records. It also includes some knowledge of the practices and procedures of those being managed or served, for example a Quartermaster will necessarily have some knowledge of military procedure (although not to the same extent they understand military supply logistics and requisition procedures), and a Librarian will know how libraries are organized but also have some  familiarity  with  how  scholars  make  efficient use of the library. Some administrative vocations may require other skills and in many circumstances these may be usable as Complementary skills (e.g., Math -ematics may often be applicable as a Complementary skill to Bookkeeper, and Trading may likewise assist Quartermaster or vice versa).

Specializations : Bookkeeper, Librarian, Officer, Man -ager, Quartermaster, Seneschal.

seRvice

[Pr] Vocations  that  primarily  deal  with  interaction and providing services to others are part of the Ser -vice  skill.  Interacting  with  customers  and  clients  is a critical part of these vocations, and those with the skill know how to present and conduct themselves in the course of business as well as how to find clients. Many service vocations will require other skills (e.g., an Innkeeper may know Trading or Culinary, a Guide will need Region Lore, a Researcher will need Lore or Science skills). Such skills will often be usable as Complementary skills,  e.g.  Bodyguard  may  be  used as  Complementary  to  Perception  while  protecting  a client.

Specializations : Bodyguard, Bonesetter, Casino Dealer/Croupier,  Guardsman,  Guide,  Innkeeper,  Researcher, Shaman, Sailor, Teacher, Valet.

tRade

[Re] This  skill  includes  vocations  that  are  more  fo -cused on a specific set of trade related skills. Business and  trade  is  an  important  part  of  many  vocations, including finding customers and suppliers as well as presenting one's goods in the best light. In other cases, the vocation may represent work as part of a group or unit,  and  the  skill  represents  understanding  how  the group is coordinated and how to give and receive or -ders and instructions. Many trades require other skills and these may often be applicable as Complementary skills, e.g., a Farmer may use Survival to predict the best weather for sowing and harvesting, or a craftsman will typically require a specific craft skill in addition to this skill to represent their business knowledge. In other cases different skills are needed for different as -pects of the occupation, e.g., the Thief vocation may assist in identifying marks and targets as well as selling purloined goods, but without Stalking and Locks (or at least a little talent with a cudgel) the knowledge will be of little use.

Specializations : Blacksmith, Carpenter, Farmer, Fence, Gambler, Herdsman, Hunter, Merchant, Miner, Pirate, Sailor, Scribe, Soldier, Thief, Tinker, Trapper, Weaver.

### 4. Talents

Every person is unique, and while characters can differ by profession, stats, and skills, there are other differ -ences that are not covered by those variations. Talents offer a special benefit or bonus, while flaws give some sort of disadvantage or penalty. The term 'talents' is used throughout but can refer to either talents or flaws.

If a character improves a talent to a higher tier, he must pay the cost of the higher tier minus the cost of the current tier. If a character wants to reduce or remove a  flaw,  he  must  pay  the  cost  difference  between  the current tier and the tier it is being reduced to.

A sampling of  talent  descriptions  is  given  here,  but is by no means exhaustive. Gamemasters may design talents based on the setting, or may approve player-de -signed talents. However, talents are not automatically available  to  take,  unless  the  GM  specifically  allows them. Almost  all  talents  modify  or  change  the  way the rules work, so they are far more likely to create problems in game balance than are skills. Additional -ly, some or all talents may be inappropriate for some settings.

When purchasing talents, there should also be some source, background, or reasoning for the talent; talents the  character  starts  with  should  be  woven  into  that character's  background,  while  talents  acquired  later should  develop  as  a  consequence  of  the  character's experiences.

#### Purchasing Talents

Talents  cost  Development  Points,  just  like  skills. However, the costs are fixed for all professions, and they cost more than most skills. Flaws cost negative Development  Points,  which  means  they  'give  back' points  which  may  be  spent  on  other  things.  They may be taken during character generation or as part

| Table 4-0:   | Table 4-0:   |
|--------------|--------------|
| Maximum      | Talent Costs |
| Average      | 10           |
| Superior     | 20           |
| Heroic       | 30           |
| Legendary    | 40           |
| Epic         | 50           |

of a level advancement. However,  if  the flaw does not hinder the character,  it  cannot  be taken.  If  a  player  asks for his fighter to be able to  take  'Inept:  Power Development I', he must actually take a rank  in  Power  Devel -opment.

Many talents give a benefit and cost in multiple tiers, with the least powerful tier being assigned a Roman numeral  I,  while  additional  tiers  are  more  effective (and more expensive) as they go up the Roman numer -als. Most talents have 5 (V) or fewer tiers, although some have up to ten (X). When the talent is taken, the tier must be specified and paid for.

Example: Lysenta takes 'Prodigy II' (Tier II) in Creature Lore and thus gets +10 bonus (+5 / Tier) to the skill for a cost of 12 DP (6 DP/Tier x 2 Tiers). She later is captured by a necromancer and held in a hanging cage, where she can observe undead creatures at a closer proximity than is normally possible for the living, and then is rescued a month later. To reflect her new perspective on the undead she wants to improve this talent to Tier III (18 DP) and so pays the difference of 18 (Tier III) - 12 (Tier II) = 6 DP to increase her bonus from +10 to +15.

Example: A troll character wants to reduce 'Light Sensitivity II' (-20 DP) to 'Light Sensitivity I' (-10 DP) before starting play. The GM and player decide that his family was bred as an improved breed of sunlight resistant troll and he pays the difference of 10 DP to reduce the penalty.

Some of the more expensive talents may upset game balance in a campaign. The game's Power Level (Sec -tion 12.1) determines the maximum number of DP that may be spent on a single talent as indicated in Table 4-0. The assumed Power Level, unless the Gamemas -ter decides otherwise, is Superior.

Restricted Talents

Talents  or  flaws  may  be  modified  to  only  have  an effect  in  certain  situations.  For  example,  a  wizard may have a magical talent that only works during the day, or dwarves get a penalty to Endurance but only while swimming. In these cases the cost of the talent or flaw should be cut in half. As always this is subject to the GM who may rule the cost should be higher or lower depending on how common the situation is deemed to be.

Most combat talents are taken in one specific attack (a  Combat  Training  specialization)  and  will  usually specify a specific kind of skill (e.g., melee, ranged). The GM may restrict these combat talents by the par -ticular fighting style (e.g., a style utilizing long blades allows access to the Aggressive and Fast Attack tal -ents). The GM is encouraged to design specific styles with new and unique combat talents.

Deadeye ......................................................... 7 / Tier You  have  uncanny  aim  with  a  ranged  weapon.  All range penalties for a ranged Combat Training special -ization may be reduced by up to 10/Tier.

Fast Attack  .................................................. 10 / Tier Your quick reflexes permit you to act before others. You gain +5/Tier to your Initiative.

Foiler ............................................................. 7 / Tier

You have incorporated moves in one Melee Weapon or  Unarmed  specialization  designed  to  cause  your opponent  to  mishandle  his  weapon. Any  round  you use an appropriate weapon or unarmed attack, any foe attacking  you  that  you  are  aware  of  has  the  fumble numbers of all of his attacks increased by 1/Tier.

Opportunistic Strike .............................................15

You  have  learned  to  take  advantage  of  your  foe's misfortunes with one Melee Weapon or Unarmed spe -cialization.  If  in  melee  combat  with  a  foe,  and  your foe fumbles, you may make an immediate attack roll against  him  (in  addition  to  any  normal  attack  that round). This attack does not require any AP and your OB is not reduced for the number of AP used or for Parrying.

Pressing the Advantage  ................................ 5 / Tier You have an aggressive fighting style. Every time you inflict a critical on your opponent using one selected Melee Weapon or Unarmed specialization, you gain a +10 OB/Tier to your next attack against this foe.

Quickdraw/Quickload ............................................7 Slow on the Draw .................................................. -5

As Quickdraw, you have mastered drawing a weapon or, with Quickload, loading a missile weapon quickly. Drawing  or  loading  for  a  specified  ranged  Combat Training specialization is treated as instantaneous (0 AP) rather than 1 AP. As Slow on the Draw, you are clumsy  with  all  weapons  when  surprised.  Drawing your weapon or readying an arrow takes you 2 AP.

Riposte  ....................................................................20

When using all of your OB to parry with one Melee Weapon or Unarmed specialization, you may attempt a riposte attack. If the parry is effective (no hits deliv -ered), you may make an immediate (0 AP) attack with an OB of 50 minus the foe's total modified attack roll. (e.g., an attack roll of 35 would result in a +15 riposte attack, while an attack roll of 70 would result in a -20 riposte attack).

Sense Weakness .....................................................20

You are able to sense a foe's weakness by observing him for one round (requiring Concentration for that round and a successful Perception maneuver, at Medi -um difficulty unless visibility is poor). With a Success, you may reroll one critical against him (the second roll stands). You may decide after your initial critical roll whether to use your reroll or save it for a later attack. You may sense the weakness of the same foe again after you have used your reroll. If you sense the weak -ness of a different foe before using your reroll, the first reroll is lost.

Sharpshooter ................................................ 5 / Tier

You  have  learned  the  importance  of  patience  when using your ranged weapon. For each full round you spend aiming, you gain +5 to your OB with one ranged Combat Training specialization, to a maximum of +5/ Tier.

#### 4.2. Discipline

Frenzy  .....................................................................20

You can enter a frenzied rage with a successful Ad -renal Focus maneuver. While frenzied, you gain a +5 Strength  bonus,  your  attacks  are  treated  as  +1  Size, and  you  suffer  no  penalties  due  to  hit  loss.  Instead of falling unconscious at 0 Hits, you will continue to fight until you reach negative hits equal to your Body Development skill, at which point you will fall uncon -scious. Once unconscious you must make a Physical RR each round until you either fail (and die) or are healed enough hits to be above this threshold. While frenzied, you get no Defensive Bonus other than that due  to  magic  and  are  unable  to  allocate  OB  to  par -ry  attacks.  Furthermore,  you  will  always  attack  the closest creature (medium Perception roll required to distinguish  friend  from  foe)  and  an  Adrenal  Focus maneuver is required to exit the frenzied rage. If there are no animate targets left to attack, you will destroy anything else within reach until knocked unconscious or  you  make  a  successful  maneuver  to  come  out  of frenzy.

#### 4.4. Physical

| Ambidextrous ........................................................10   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

You are able to use either  hand  equally  well  for  all maneuvers and activities. The normal -20 penalty for off-hand usage does not apply.

Beast of Burden .......................................... 10 / Tier

Your  body  is  particularly  well-suited  for  carrying heavy loads. You  may  carry  an  additional  10%/Tier of your body weight as encumbrance without penalty, except that encumbrance penalties are not reduced for purposes of Dodging.

| Slow Bleeder ............................................... 25 / Tier   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rapid Bleeder............................................ -25 / Tier     |

Your body has an abnormal ability or inability to clot bleeding  wounds.  Each  bleeding  injury  is  reduced (Slow Bleeder) or increased (Rapid Bleeder) by 1 hit/ round for each Tier. Slow Bleeder may prevent bleed -ing entirely. The injury is modified at the moment it is inflicted; it does not clot/open an additional 1 point of bleeding each round.

Uncoordinated ............................................. -10 / -20

You  are  terribly  uncoordinated  and  have  a  difficult time moving and performing other actions. Penalties to  actions  made  while  moving  are  treated  as  if  you were moving 1 pace (Tier I) or 2 paces (Tier II) higher than your actual pace.

#### 4.5. Racial

Racial talents are talents that are normally only used for the creation of races. However, in some unusual, magical,  or  divine  circumstances,  the  Gamemaster may allow them to be purchased during character cre -ation or normal character advancement.

Additional Limb Pair ................................. 20 / Tier

You possess an additional pair of arms per Tier. The additional  arms  may  be  used  to  manipulate  and  to make  attacks  (with  the  usual  penalties  for  multiple attacks).  If  the  additional  limbs  are  legs  and  unable to make attacks, use Increased Stride rather than this talent.

Breath Holding ......................................................10

You may hold your breath for up to 1 minute per char -acter  level.  If  you  remain  inactive,  the  time  may  be doubled, or tripled with a successful Meditation ma -neuver.

Darkvision  ...................... 10 for Tier I, then 5 / Tier You  can  see  10'/Tier  even  in  complete  darkness. Nightvision is normally a prerequisite for this talent.

Defensive Aura ............................................. 6 / Tier A glowing or blurred aura surrounds you, making you more difficult to target. You receive +5 DB/Tier, which is not cumulative with any Aura or Blur spell.

Efficient Sleeper ................................................ 5 / 10 Restless Sleeper ............................................... -4 / -8

As  an  Efficient  Sleeper  you  require  less  sleep  than most people, able to get benefits from 3 hours (Tier I) or 2 hours (Tier II) of sleep as others do in 4. As a Restless Sleeper you toss and turn and have a hard time getting restful sleep and thus must sleep 5 hours (Tier I) or 6 hours (Tier II) to get the benefit of 4 hours. Both Efficient Sleeper and Restless Sleeper will change the rate  at  which  you recover Power Points, but not the total you recover per night of sleep. For example, Tier II of Efficient Sleeper allows you to recover twice as many Power Points per hour but you will not recover more by sleeping more than your required 4 hours of sleep per night.

| Your hearing is equivalent to that of a cat. It is not more sensitive to most sounds than the hearing of a human, but you are able to hear very high-pitched sounds, such as some calls of rats and mice and those of sonar-using bats. In addition, you have an improved ability to determine the location of a sound's source, gaining +10 on Perception maneuvers to locate a sound. Hearing, Dog ..........................................................15 You have hearing as sensitive as a dog.

| Natural Armor .............................................. 5 / Tier Your skin (hide, carapace, etc.) is resistant to attacks as if you were wearing armor and gives +1 AT / Tier (AT 1 is no armor). This natural armor moves with you and incurs no encumbrance or maneuver penalties. It also does not interfere with magic, so it provides no RR bonus against spells, nor does it hinder your own casting. If combined with worn armor, use the higher AT (do not add them together), and if the worn armor is heavier add the number of tiers as DB. Natural Weaponry ..................................................5 You have some type of natural weaponry (e.g., a Claw, Sting, Horn, etc.) and may develop skill with and make attacks equal to your size. Use the Attack or Lesser Attack talent to increase or for free, although one cannot natural weaponry at less   | for taking Sight, Gecko 10 Your eyes perform like those of a gecko, permitting additional detail close-up as well as good depth vision and you do not lose your color vision in dark condi - tions (normal penalties for darkness still apply).

Talents  affecting  the  senses  are  most  often  taken  at character  creation,  as  they  represent  innate  abilities one is born with. However, in magical or divine cir -cumstances,  or  even  unusually  intense  training,  the GM may allow them to be taken during normal char -acter advancement.

Animal Empathy ........... 15 for Tier I, then 5 / Tier You have an affinity with a particular kind of animal.

If a target is  trying  to  hide  his  emotions,  he  gets  a  Resistance Roll  vs.  your  level;  Success  means  that  you  cannot 'read' that target for 24 hours. This ability grants a +50 bonus to Social Awareness when appropriate.

You  can  sense  something  that  normally  cannot  be sensed  (allowing  Perception  rolls).  This  sense  must be specified when taken, and appropriately described (e.g.,  'able  to  smell  fear'  or  'can  feel  evil  magic'). The GM should be wary about how broadly a sense is described, and may narrow it.

- Tier I : Sense things inside body or affecting character (i.e., like taste).
- Tier II : Sense things in contact with body (i.e., like feel/touch).
- Tier III : General sense of direction and intensi -ty (i.e., like smell). Can attack otherwise unseen targets at -50.
- Tier IV : Direction, intensity, and distance, weak on specific details (i.e., like hearing). Can attack otherwise unseen targets at -25.
- Tier V : Can sense in specific detail (i.e., like sight), can attack otherwise unseen targets nor -mally using just this sense.

Missing Sense .................................................. varies You are completely missing a sense: taste (-5), feel/ touch (-10), smell (-10), hearing (-15), or sight (-20). You  suffer  a  -100  penalty  on  actions  requiring  the sense (if it is possible at all) and from -20 to -50 on actions which would benefit from the sense (e.g. -20 might  be  appropriate  for  a  deaf  character  on  a  Per -ception check to avoid being ambushed, while -50 is appropriate for many maneuvers for blind characters). Deaf characters (and others) may develop lip-reading for a given language as a Language specialization.

One Eye ................................................................ -10 You  have  sight  only  in  one  eye.  The  other  may  be missing, replaced with a glass eye, or covered with an eyepatch. You lack distance perception and peripheral vision on the affected side, and all ranged attacks suf -fer a -25 penalty.

Visions .......................... 30 for Tier I, then 10 / Tier You are  able  to  receive  spontaneous  visions  of  per -sons/places/objects based upon objects that you touch with your bare skin. The details of the vision are at the discretion  of  the  GM,  but  should  reveal  details  of  a significant event relating to the object, if any. (That a knife was touched by a rat two days ago is usually an insignificant event, that it was used to murder some -one a week ago is usually very significant). This can be used one time per day for every Tier.

Distinct Odor ....................................................... -10

You have a distinct odor, which will transfer to objects you touch with bare skin. This grants a +50 bonus to Perception and Tracking efforts based on smell. (If the odor is foul or unpleasant enough to harm social inter -actions, the character should also take the 'Inept' flaw for Influence skills).

Disturbing Voice

........................................

-10 / Tier

You have a grating or annoying tone of voice. This gives a penalty of -20/Tier to any maneuver to verbal -ly calm or persuade (Influence, Singing, Leadership, etc.).

Golden Throat .............................................. 5 / Tier You have a soothing  and  calming  voice. This  gives +10/Tier  to  any  maneuver  to  verbally  calm  or  per -suade (Charm, Singing, Leadership, etc.).

Iron Will  ........................................................ 4 / Tier You have formidable willpower, and get a bonus of +5/Tier to Resistance Rolls versus mental spells (at -tack, informational, or otherwise).

Look of Eagles ............................................ 10 / Tier With  the  gift  of  inspiration,  you  get  +10/Tier  to  all Leadership  maneuvers  and  followers  get  +2/Tier  to fear RRs.

Math Illiterate ..................................................... -10

You never learned basic math and have a very hard time with numbers. You cannot add or subtract with -out  your  fingers,  cannot  multiply  at  all,  and  cannot count higher than 20.

Multilingual .............................................................8

You grew up in a multilingual culture or have always been  able  to  learn  languages  quickly  when  you  im -merse yourself in them. You gain 10 ranks in one lan -guage or 5 ranks in each of two languages.

Mute ..................................................................... -10 You cannot speak, although you can understand speech and may communicate via other means such as sign language or gesture if you have the ability to do so.

Neutral Odor .........................................................10 You naturally have a very weak odor. This makes all attempts  to  perceive  your  presence  based  upon  the sense  of  smell  operate  at  -50.  This  penalty  may  be reduced if you are carrying any objects or equipment that carry strong odors (e.g., garlic, rotting fish).

Non-violent................................................... -5 / Tier You do not want to hurt others, and flinch with remorse when doing so. After inflicting a critical, any action you take in the following round suffers a penalty of -20/Tier.

Perfect Pitch ................................................. 7 / Tier

You have perfect pitch and are able to reproduce any pitch with either your voice (if possible with your vo -cal  cords)  or  an  appropriate  instrument. This  allows you to play most pieces of music after hearing them. You get +10/Tier to any Performance Art: Singing or Play Instrument skill. This cannot be combined with Golden Throat to get a higher bonus to Singing. Use the talent with the highest bonus.

| Prodigy.......................................................... 6 / Tier    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inept ............................................................. -4 / Tier |

You have some unusual innate ability or supernatural aid that gives a bonus of +5/Tier to a single skill (all specializations). Or, you are inexplicably jinxed and suffer  -5/Tier  to  all  maneuvers  in  a  single  skill  (all specializations).

Restricted Diet  ....................................................... -5

Your diet  is  limited  to  certain  foods  which  are  nor -mally available but may not be in all circumstances. Other foods either provide no sustenance or will cause you to operate at significant penalties (whether due to upset stomach or wracking guilt) of at least -20 for the next 24 hours. Examples include a completely vege -tarian diet or a carnivore diet which depends entirely on meat. A restricted diet may increase the cost of your provisions or decrease the chance of finding suitable fare.

Revulsion .............................................................. -15

You  cannot  stand  the  sight  of  blood.  Each  round  a bleeding character (or a bloody corpse) is in view, you must make a Fear/Terror RR equal to the amount of bleeding that is visible (so if you can see two com -batants, one bleeding 3/round, and one bleeding at 2/ round, the fear RR is vs. a level 5 attack). Treat bloody corpses as 10/round bleeding for this calculation.

### 5. Maneuvers &amp; Movement

Maneuvers are actions that have a chance of failing and entail an element of risk. Thus, normal movement and activities such as walking, climbing stairs, draw -ing  a  weapon,  etc.  are  not  maneuvers  under  normal circumstances.  However,  unusual  activities  or  those performed  under  stress  are  maneuvers  and  require rolls (e.g., climbing a cliff, running over rough terrain, opening a locked chest). The GM is the final judge as to what is a maneuver and requires a roll, and what is normal activity and does not require a roll.

Movement, whether it constitutes a maneuver or not, is  important  for  adventurers. Whether it is  a  race  to cut off an enemy, a climb to a hidden citadel, or a long march to a distant destination, few goals are reached by remaining in one's seat.

Both maneuvers and movement may be performed at the  cost  of  fatigue.  Every  character  has  their  limits, and their goals may drive them to find and sometimes attempt to exceed those limits.

#### 5.1. Maneuvers

Maneuvers  are  resolved  by  rolling  d100OE  plus  or minus any modifiers and consulting Table 5-1 for the result. A  maneuver  roll  can  be  modified  by  various factors  such  as  skills,  encumbrance,  armor,  special equipment,  or  skill-specific  situations  (see  skill  de -scriptions). The sum of these bonuses and penalties is added to the maneuver roll to determine the maneuver total. Any  maneuver  requiring  movement  or  precise motions  is  penalized  by  an  encumbrance  penalty (Section  5.4),  if  applicable,  and  an  armor  maneuver penalty, if wearing armor (Section 7.2).

The GM will decide how long the maneuver should take.  If  the  maneuver  is  occurring  during  a  combat, it should be measured in terms of rounds (Chapter 8: The Combat Round), which are 5 seconds long. More than  one  round  may  be  required  for  maneuvers  the GM determines are difficult or complex.

##### Maneuver Difficulties

Maneuvers will vary in difficulty based on the situa -tion. The GM determines the difficulty level (listed at the bottom of Table 5-1) based on the specifics of the maneuver, the environment it is being performed in, and possibly the amount of time taken. Results will depend on whether this is an Absolute or Percentage maneuver.

If the character wishes to perform a precision maneu -ver deliberately by taking longer, the GM may lower the difficulty. Some maneuvers may be just as difficult no  matter  how  much  time  a  character  devotes  to  it. Guidance for determining difficulties is given in the skill descriptions (Chapter 3: Skills). Some maneuvers may be deemed impossible and the player should be advised that such a maneuver is doomed to automatic failure.

Example: Doing a backflip off a table may be Very Hard (-20), while a backflip off a table in a crowded bar may be Extremely Hard (-30)

Example: Performing bawdy drinking songs for drunken sailors might be a Simple (+50) task, while performing dirge music at a festive party might be Sheer Folly (-50) task.

Example: Jumping across a pit with only a narrow rocky ledge from which to jump (standing long jump) may be a Very Hard (-30) maneuver. Note that the distance is already accounted for by a modifier given in the Jumping skill description.

Example: Hildrikki is left alone in the Duke' s study, and makes a quick attempt to use her Locks skill to open the Duke's safe. With only 5 minutes to try, the GM tells her the difficulty of quickly picking a top of the line masterwork dwarven combination lock is Nigh Impossible (-100). She tries and fails. Hildrikki sneaks back that night when the Duke is out and gives herself an hour to pick the lock on the safe. The GM deems this an Extremely Hard (-30) task.

##### Absolute Maneuvers

Absolute Maneuvers include any instance where you either succeed or fail and cannot build up to a com -plete  success,  because  any  failed  steps  result  in  the whole failing completely or, at best, needing to start over again from scratch (e.g., jumping over a chasm or successfully hiding).

Some skills may have their own Absolute Maneuver table, which may be used instead of Table 5-1, or the GM may adjust the generic Absolute Maneuver result from Table 5-1 based on the skill used and situation. The thresholds for success and failure are the same, but  the  individual  tables  provide  more  detailed  sug -gestions for the GM to describe the outcome. Regard -

less of the table used, an Absolute Maneuver will give one of five results, plus a possible unusual event:

- Absolute Failure : Not only do you fail, but you make the situation worse. The attempt should have some additional result above and beyond just failing to accomplish the task itself: a tool ruined, an injury, or guaranteeing the success of an opposed maneuver.

Example: A character gets an Absolute Failure while trying to stalk. He trips and falls noisily, immediately alerting anyone within earshot (no perception roll required).

Example: Tusira the smith gets an Absolute Failure when making a sword. Not only does she fail, ending with a useless lump of steel, but she cracks the handle of her hammer in the process.

- Failure : The attempted task fails. Only if the maneuver involved direct peril like jumping over a pit does injury result, but the attempt fails, time and any resources are expended to no positive result. Roll &lt; 1
- Unusual Event : Any unmodified 66 roll on an Absolute Maneuver gives an unusual result. This does not change the success or failure of the final result (add any mod -ifiers as normal to determine the overall degree of success), but the GM should add some twist to the result.
- Partial Success : If the GM does not feel the maneuver can be par -tially succeeded at, treat this as a Failure result. If instead the GM decides a partial success is possible, then the task is partially done in some way, but should definite -ly fall short of complete success. The GM may choose to allow another attempt to complete the task if the situation allows for it. The GM may wish to use partial successes as a way to increase dramatic tension.
- Success : Time and resources are expended as expected, and the attempt succeeds, producing the result desired.
- Absolute Success : Not only does the task succeed, but it is done in such a manner that there is some additional benefit: it is done faster, with fewer resources, or with such style that it inspires a bonus for the character or those observing at the GM's discretion.

- Example: A character gets an Absolute Failure on a jump over a pit. He smashes into the other side (taking an A Krush critical) before falling down the pit and taking damage from the fall.
- Example: A Partial Success by a character attempting to jump over a chasm results in her not quite making it to the other side and hanging on by her fingers, requiring others to come to her aid, or a subsequent climbing maneuver to pull herself up.
- Example: A Partial Success for throwing a bucket of paint intended to cover a target would only partially cover it.
- Example: An Absolute Success for jumping down off a balcony results in the character landing on a table which tips over into the way of the guards, just as the character casually steps off of it.
- Example: An Unusual Event, but failed Performing Arts maneuver might have gained sympathy from one onlooker, while everyone else booed.
- Example: Anriadel gets an Unusual Event and succeeds at a Creature Lore: Dragon check while looking for information on dragons in the church library. Not only does she find useful information, she also finds a bit of paper tucked into one of the books, left by a previous researcher, that lists some books that can be found at the military college with more information on the subject.

##### Percentage Maneuvers

Percentage Maneuvers are used for any attempt where a  partial  or  graduated  success  is  possible,  such  as how well one does on an exam or physical test, or for situations the GM feels the character will eventually succeed at unless he totally messes up but the amount of time it takes is important. This may be climbing a cliff, digging out a collapsed passageway, or any other action where, short of disaster, the character will even -tually accomplish the task.

A numeric result indicates that percentage of the task is completed, and these percentage results are cumula -tive (e.g., a 50 result followed by a 20 result means that the task is 70% complete). Once a Percentage Maneu -ver makes or exceeds a cumulative 100%, the task has successfully  been  completed.  Some  maneuvers  may be  paused  while  the  character  does  something  else, while others cannot. The GM is the ultimate arbiter as to whether a task can be stopped and then resumed or if the player must start over from 0%.

Example: Kulas-Dar is turning a crank, which raises the drawbridge of the castle, an arduous task for one man to do by himself. After some time spent cranking, Kulas-Dar has the drawbridge 50% raised, but he is then attacked and stops to fight. The GM decides that the crank has a locking lever, so the bridge remains 50% up, and Kulas-Dar can resume cranking the drawbridge up if he wins the fight. The GM could have made a different decision and said that the crank was unlocked and the drawbridge crashed back down as soon as Kulas-Dar took his hands off the crank, forcing him to restart from 0%.

A 'fail to act' result means the character just doesn't do anything, while lower results indicate some sort of catastrophic failure. If the failure results from attempt -ing  a  moving  maneuver,  such  as  running,  climbing, etc., then the character takes an Unbalancing critical of the indicated severity. For non-moving maneuvers the GM should introduce some other penalty or cost beyond just the lost time and effort.

- Example: While taking her time slowly picking a lock, Hildrikki rolls open-ended down for a result of -35. The GM decides her tools are broken in the attempt. Guess this lock won't be opening today.

Results of over 100% (110, 120, 130, 140, and 150) mean the task is completed more quickly than normal, or that the character has moved even farther than nor -mal. An 'Exceptional Success' result should be treated as 150 as well as providing some further advantage, such  as  a  superior  finished  product,  a  bonus  to  the character's next action or inspiring allies who see the incredible move.

5.2. Feats of Strength

Characters  often  have  to  lift,  pull,  or  push  things during a game, or two characters may be engaged in a contest of strength like an arm wrestle or tug of war. There  is  no  need  to  roll  every  time  someone  picks something up. The rules are intended for use in stress -ful  situations in which someone is lifting something in combat time, or when someone attempts to lift very large weights. Under most circumstances it will usual -ly not be worthwhile to require a maneuver for feats of strength that are of Easy or less difficulty.

Feats  of  strength  normally  use  the  Weight-Training skill and may be Absolute or Percentage Maneuvers, depending on the situation. If the feat has no real rest point, like picking up a heavy barrel or lifting a gate, then an all or nothing Absolute Maneuver should be used. To keep an object lifted a maneuver roll must be made every round. If the feat has rest points like

pushing  open  a  huge  door,  lifting  something  with  a pulley, or dragging a heavy object across a floor, use a Percentage Maneuver for every 10' the object must be moved.

A  feat  of  strength  is  also  used  when  breaking  free from  a  grapple.  Use  Wrestling  or  Contortions  skill, with the defender subject to the full grapple penalty, and resolve as a conflicting Percentage Maneuver. The

grapple percentage is reduced by the result. For more details see Grapple in Section 9.8.

Table 5-2 gives the difficulty of the maneuver based on the item's weight (in terms of percent of body weight of  the  character  trying  to  move  it)  minus  twice  the character's strength bonus (a negative strength bonus will increase this percentage).  What might be a severe challenge to a 35-pound goblin may only be difficult for a 150-pound human, and merely a casual effort for a 1,500-pound giant. The GM may further adjust the difficulty based on the situation.

Example: Stongar has a +3 St bonus, weighs 150 pounds, and has a +50 in Weight Training. He wants to pick up a 100-pound barrel of wine and move it out of the way. 100 pounds is 66% of Stongar's weight, which is reduced to 60% due to his strength bonus, so it is a Hard maneuver at +50 to move the barrel. Because he is picking it up and moving it, there is no 'rest point' and this is an Absolute Maneuver. If the barrel were covered in grease, the GM may increase the difficulty to Extremely Hard to represent the difficulty of grasping it.

Example: A 75-pound goblin and a 150-pound human are in a tug of war (each has a +0 Strength bonus). The goblin is pulling 200% of his weight for a Sheer Folly (-50) maneuver, while the human is pulling 50% of her weight for a Medium (0) maneuver. This makes it very likely the human will win this contest, unless it is Conan the goblin.

Mechanical Advantage

Dragging, pushing, or pulling something can reduce an item's effective weight. Wheels, pulleys, and other forms  of  mechanical  advantage  can  also  reduce  the effective weight, drastically. These techniques can be used  either  for  items  carried  (normal  encumbrance) such as pulling a cart or for feats of strength such as lifting a stone block with a lever.

If all of the weight is resting on the ground, and the character  is  merely  pulling/pushing  it  along,  cut  the weight of the dragged object in half before calculating encumbrance. If using wheels, pulleys or other forms of mechanical advantage the reduction will be greater, usually a reduction to one-third to one-fifth the actual weight, with a theoretical maximum benefit of reduc -ing the effort to one-hundredth the object's weight.

Example: Stongar wants to pull a 5,000-pound block of stone out of the way. This would normally be impossible, but he got a magician to levitate the block first. The GM rules that since there is almost no friction or resistance the effective weight of the block is 1/100 its normal weight, or 50 pounds. Stonger strains a bit, makes his roll, and pulls the giant block away from the opening to the tomb.

5.3. Movement

Movement includes all types of movement, including walking, running, flying, climbing, and swimming. All characters  and  creatures  are  given  a  movement  rate in  feet  per  5  seconds  (the  length  of  a  tactical  combat round) called their Base Movement Rate (BMR), which is  the  speed  at  which  they  'walk'  (an  unhasty  speed whether swimming, flying, etc., but still called walk for pace purposes).

For normal movement, a roll is not required; however, for stressful situations such as moving in rough terrain or  while  stunned,  a  movement  roll  is  required  (using the appropriate skill of Running, Swimming, etc.). For example, a combatant who is running in a zigzag to -ward an enemy outpost should make a maneuver roll; likewise, a maneuver roll is called for if a combatant is stunned or moving across slick ground, broken terrain, or other similar obstacles.

The BMR is determined by Quickness bonus and stride modifier.  The  character's  race  (or  height  if  using  the Individual  Stride  optional  rule)  determines  the  stride modifier.  For  swimming  or  flying,  use  the  creature's appropriate  dimension  (e.g.  length  or  wingspan).  An average humanoid has a BMR of 20'/rnd. Multiply the BMR by 12 to get the distance in feet per minute (e.g., 240'/minute) or by 0.14 to get miles per hour (e.g., 2.8 mph) if these are needed.

BMR = 20' + Quickness/2 + Stride

One  can  move  slower  or  faster,  up  to  5  times  one's BMR, assuming  one  is  not  limited  by  encumbrance.

Table  5-3  summarizes  the  different  paces,  from  x1/2 to  x5  one's  BMR.  For  each  pace,  the  table  gives  the maximum speed multiplier for the round or per phase and the Action Point cost (Section 8.1) or pace penalty that applies to other actions performed in the round (for actions outside of combat, use the listed pace penalty). Note the difficulty of the terrain applies a modifier to the movement roll, while the penalty due to pace (i.e., pace penalty) is a modifier applied to any other actions performed while moving at that pace (e.g., while fight -ing or casting spells). The difficulty of movement does not affect the pace penalty, nor does the pace penalty affect the maneuver roll for movement itself.

Characters can move backwards up to a jog pace, but their  speed  is  halved.  Characters  who  are  prone  can move no faster than 'jog' pace, at half speed, and can take no other action while moving.

The maximum pace is limited by the total load a char -acter is carrying. The load limit shown for each pace is the maximum load, as a percentage of the character's weight, which permits movement at the specified pace. For example, a character carrying 35% of his weight could move at a Run but not at a Sprint. Characters car -rying heavy loads will likely also incur Encumbrance penalties  which  will  increase  the  difficulty  of  their moving maneuvers; see the next section for details. For extremely heavy loads, carried at a Creep pace, use the Feats of Strength rules in the previous section to deter -mine whether the character is able to move the load.

5.4.  Encumbrance

Characters  often  perform  athletic  feats,  and  the  dif -ficulties are based on the GM's judgment. Most real world examples that may be used for comparison as -sume a well-trained modern athlete wearing nothing more than very light clothing and a pair of sneakers. The addition of armor and field gear makes maneuvers harder than they would be for the completely unbur -dened  athlete.  Encumbrance  is  the  measure  of  how much a character's equipment hampers maneuvering.

The Encumbrance Penalty is applied to all maneuvers that  the  GM  deems  are  affected  by  equipment. This includes most movement and physical maneuvers, but not Combat Training skills (e.g., OB and parry). It will also affect Endurance rolls.

Characters can carry a fixed amount of weight before incurring a penalty. If the Weight Allowance is nega -tive, treat it as 0% (the character is so weak carrying anything incurs a penalty).

WA (%) = 15% + 2 x Strength Modifier

<!-- image -->

cumbrance Penalty is the difference between the load (in % body weight) and the weight allowance (% body weight). Add  up  the  weight  of  all  gear  carried  and worn and divide by the characters body weight.

Enc. Penalty = Load (%) - WA (%)

The Encumbrance Penalty cannot be negative (it can -not add to maneuvers!).

Example: Stongar, who weighs 220 lbs. and has a Strength modifier of +3, is wearing a full suit of mail (21% of body weight so 46 lbs), carrying a normal shield (8 lbs), and an additional 21 lbs worth of gear for a total of 75 lbs. This is 34% of Stongar's body weight so his Encumbrance Penalty is 34 - (15 + 6) = 13.

Encumbrance during the game

The calculations given above are quick and easy if you know the total weight carried and the amount doesn't change. During the game, it is much more useful to know how much weight in pounds can be carried be -fore a penalty is incurred, and then how much more weight  carries  what  penalty.  Calculate  the  weight allowance  in  pounds  using  the  body  weight  of  the character.

WA (lbs) = WA (%) * Body Weight / 100

For simplicity during play, small weights may be ig -nored. Instead, apply an Encumbrance Penalty of 5 for every 5% of the characters body weight beyond the weight allowance.

Enc. Penalty = 5 every (Body Weight/20) &gt; WA (lbs)

Example: The 220 lb Stongar has a Strength modifier of +3, giving him a weight allowance of (15 + 6) = 21% of his body weight, about 46 lbs. weight without penalty. For every (220/20) = 11 lbs after that he has an encumbrance penalty of 5. Therefore, at 57 lbs he has -5, 68 lbs a -10, etc.

Fitted Armor

Armor  is  given  average  weights  for  medium-sized creatures. However, armor is also given in % of body weight, because armor for larger characters is heavier, and for smaller characters is lighter. To get the weight of armor, determine the weight by the % given by the armor (Table 6-4 in Chapter 6) and the weight of the wearer.

#### 5.5. Fatigue

Characters  often  engage  in  physically  strenuous  ac -tivity (e.g., running, marching, climbing, swimming, and fighting) and run the risk of becoming fatigued. Encumbrance,  activity,  hunger,  sleep,  and  environ -mental factors can have a great impact on how quickly a character may succumb to exhaustion.

Characters will be periodically required (based on ac -tivity as indicated on Table 5-5) to make Endurance rolls in order to avoid becoming tired. An Endurance roll is an Absolute Maneuver using the Body Develop -ment skill bonus, any racial Endurance modifier, and applicable  modifiers  from  Table  5-5.  Failure  means the character accrues a penalty of -5 to -20 that applies to all actions. Success means the character pushes on ahead without acquiring any additional penalties. An Absolute Success may even see the character shaking off some accumulated fatigue in a surge of adrenaline.

A character may choose to stop whatever he is doing after rolling Endurance, but before rolling for the ac -tion (although any fatigue penalty remains). He realiz -es he is so tired he decides to stop before attempting it.

Modifiers include penalties for insufficient food, wa -ter, or sleep. For most characters, 8 hours of sleep is a  full  night,  although  certain  talents  and  flaws  will increase or decrease this amount.

Fatigue penalties may also occur from criticals. These should be considered getting winded; being outmaneu -vered, requiring additional energy to attack or defend a particular blow; or getting injured in a manner easily shaken off (like when you hit a wall with a stick and your fingers go tingly). These types of fatigue penal -ties are temporary and fade quickly when they can be shaken off (i.e., upon resting).

Altitude : The lower concentration of oxygen at higher altitudes makes it easier to become tired and increasingly difficult to recover from exertion. The difficulty of any Endurance rolls increases by -10 for every 2500' altitude  increase  (e.g.,  -10  for  2501'-5000',  -20  for 5001'-7500', etc.). Fatigue penalties at higher altitudes take twice as long to recover from. Acclimatization to a higher altitude takes about 2 weeks for every 2500 feet change (and is lost at the same rate).

It's hard work, and every bit saps your just strength. But surely you are strong enough to push on ahead. Increase fatigue pen -alty by 5.

101 - 175 Success

Between the excitement and your fortitude, you shrug off the exhaustion and are ready for whatever is coming next. You ac -cumulate no additional fatigue.

176 + Absolute Success

It's time for a marathon. You take solace in your task and feel more energized than ever to tackle what lies before you. Reduce any current fatigue penalty by 10, and gain a +5 to whatever action you are about to perform.

Temperature : Extremes  in temperature can also greatly  hinder  one's  endurance,  as  shown  in  Table 5-5. A penalty of -5 applies to all Endurance rolls for every 5° F (2.5° C) above or below the acclimatized range. For humans this is about 60° to 80° F (15° to 27.5° C). Characters can acclimate to higher or lower temperatures, which takes a week for every 5° (2.5° C) change.  Humans can acclimate to no lower than 40°F (5°C) and no higher than 100°F (37.5°C)

Proper  clothing  can  reduce  or  eliminate  problems with cold temperatures, but often is bulky, hindering motion  and  creating  encumbrance  problems.  Cold weather  gear  is  equal  to  full  coverage  Heavy  Cloth AT 2 (with AT 2 penalties), and allows a character to tolerate 20° F more on the cold extreme. Extreme cold weather gear is equal to full Soft Leather AT 3 (with AT 3 penalties), and allows a character to tolerate 40° F more on the cold extreme.

Clothing constructed to shade the wearer and reflect heat (e.g., desert nomad robes) allows a character to tolerate no more than 10° F more on the hot extreme. To gain more benefit, the character will need to take the  time  to  acclimatize. Active  cooling  or  materials that block out heat would need to be magical or rep -resent an out of the norm technological advance for a fantasy setting.

##### Extended Effort

When  a  character  will  continue  fatiguing  activities over a long period of time or until they become ex -hausted, it may be preferable to make a single maneu -ver to determine how long they can continue before incurring a penalty, rather than making many separate rolls. Make an Endurance roll as described above; on a success, the character may continue for one check interval plus an additional interval for every 10 they succeeded by (e.g., one interval on 101-110, two in -tervals  on  111-120,  etc.). At  the  end  of  that  number of intervals, increase their fatigue penalty by 10, and make a new Endurance roll with the new modifier if they will continue.

concentRation

Concentration for  long  periods  can  be  straining  and difficult  to  sustain  when  fatigued.  Concentration  re -quires  an  Endurance  roll  every  6  rounds,  using  all the fatigue modifiers including any racial Endurance modifier,  but  using  Mental  Focus  instead  of  Body Development  as  the  skill.  Every  six  rounds  (half  a minute) after the first Mental Focus roll, a cumulative 10 applies to further rolls (while concentrating on the initial maneuver). This Mental Focus roll will normal -ly be Routine (+30) if the character is not taking any other action aside from concentrating.

In calm environments (i.e., non-combat), it is easier to maintain focus with less effort. Instead, an Endurance roll  is  made  every  minute  in  order  to  maintain  con -centration. If a character is in a meditative trance (has made  a  successful  Meditation  maneuver)  an  Endur -ance roll is made every 5 minutes in order to maintain concentration.

##### Recovering From Fatigue

For every minute of rest, the accumulated fatigue pen -alty is reduced by -1. However, fatigue accumulated while  starving  or  water-deprived  requires  sufficient food or water before resting. Add up the total modifi -ers for lack of food and water; resting without food or water will only remove fatigue penalties to half of this value (but never worse than a -50 fatigue penalty). For example, a character who has gone three days without food (-30 modifier) and has a -40 fatigue penalty can rest to reduce that penalty to -15, but any further re -covery will require food.

##### Injuries due to Fatigue

Severe  exhaustion  can  cause  real  injury.  If  fatigue penalties in excess of -50 accumulate, any further fa -tigue penalties become injury penalties (Section 13.1). The GM determines the type of injury based on the circumstances (e.g., a maneuver may result in pulling a muscle, while crossing a desert may cause sunburn). The penalty could even be applied to an existing inju -ry that was made worse due to exhaustion.

Example: Quintora has an accumulated fatigue penalty of -45; to climb over the wall, she needs to make another check and rolls a Failure (resulting in an increase of -10 to her cumulative fatigue penalty). Rather than a total fatigue penalty of -55, she has a fatigue penalty of -50 and an injury that is -5. Based on the circumstances, the GM decides it is from a pulled muscle in her left shoulder. Rest will quickly get rid of the -50 fatigue, but the -5 pulled shoulder injury will take longer.

Example: Hildrikki and Sedgewick have been involved in a prolonged pursuit/fight with a band of orcs. Now that they are out of danger, they can rest and recuperate. Hildrikki, a dwarf with impressive reserves of stamina, has accumulated a -45 fatigue penalty. After resting for 45 minutes, her fatigue penalty is reduced to 0 and she is no longer fatigued. The hits and injuries she suffered during the fight will take longer to heal, but she is no longer exhausted. Sedgewick, being a puny magician, has accumulated a significant -50 fatigue penalty and a -15 injury due to fatigue (a sprained knee). 50 minutes of rest will recover the -50, but the -15 injury must be healed as a normal injury.

#### 5.6. Resistance Rolls

Some  hazards  occurring  during  play  will  require  a character to make a Resistance Roll (RR) to determine if  or  how  the  hazard  affects  him. A  Resistance  Roll is  different  from  a  maneuver  since  there  is  no  skill that  modifies it.  Only the character's stats, race, and level  (and  occasionally  other  special  modifiers  such as magic spells) will modify the Resistance Roll. The hazards  are  most  often  spells,  but  may  also  be  poi -son, disease, or fear. The stats that are used for each of the RR types are shown in Table 5-6. Channeling, Essence, and Mentalism are different realms of magic. See Spell Law for a complete treatment of realms and spellcasting. As all of these modifiers are fixed aside from the attack level, the total of the Stat, Race, Own Realm, and Target Level bonuses should be noted on the character sheet. During play, simply roll and add this total modifier, then subtract 2x the attack level.

For Resistance Rolls versus magical attacks, the roll is compared to the caster's Spellcasting roll. For Resis -tance Rolls versus other effects where there is an ap -plicable skill maneuver (e.g. Poison Mastery, Traps), the Resistance Roll is compared to the opponent's roll minus 100. For other effects (e.g., disease, fear), or in cases where there is no caster (e.g., from a magical trap) or the attacker is unknown (e.g. a poison trap in a dungeon), a 50 is required for success. The difficulty of resisting is also affected by the attack's level. In the case of a hostile spellcaster, the level of the caster is used. For magical traps and other effects, the GM may assign a level much as he would assign a difficulty to a maneuver. The GM may also assign additional mod -ifiers if other circumstances make it easier or harder to resist.

Example: Arturo, Belina and Carthos drink a bottle of poisoned wine with their dinner, all failing to notice. The GM decides one glass is one dose. Arturo barely sips his, Belina drinks her whole glass, and Carthos drinks two glasses to finish the bottle, then drinks Arturo's (failing three checks to notice the poison). The GM decides that Belina must make a normal RR for a single dose, but Arturo gets +50 for sipping a small partial dose, and Carthos gets -30 for guzzling down nearly three whole doses.

If  the  roll  (with  all  modifiers)  equals  or  exceeds  the number required, the RR succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Many RR effects are all or nothing results: if the RR fails,  the  target  takes  the  full  effects,  but  if  the  RR succeeds,  the  target  is  completely  unaffected.  Some effects  have  a  varying  severity  based  on  how  much the RR was failed by, as indicated in Table 5-6. Any failed result includes the failed effects below it, so an Extreme Failure means the target is under the effects of the Extreme, Severe, Moderate, and Mild Failures. All penalties imposed by the various levels are cumu -lative.

Example: Kulas-Dar has a +22 RR bonus vs. Physical, based on his level (8th level for +16) and Constitution (86 for a +6 bonus), with no racial bonus. He is exposed to a level 10 pneumonic disease. He needs a 50 to make the RR. His RR roll is a 7, so his total RR is 7 + 22 - 10x2 = 29 - 20 = 9, a failure by 41. This is a moderate failure and he will suffer the effects of both moderate and mild failure to a pneumonic disease.

Other RRs, such as those against some spells, are in -cremental, where every X points of failure indicates a  greater  effect.  (e.g.,  Confusion,  which  causes  the target to be confused for 1 round per 5 failure). In this case, roll the RR as usual; if the target makes the roll the target is unaffected as usual, but if the target fails, use the amount failed by to determine how many in -crements of the effect are suffered.

Example: Olamdiambo has a +40 RR bonus vs. Essence and is targeted by an Essence Confusion spell from a 15th level Illusionist. The attacker' s Spellcasting roll is a 76. Olamdiambo rolls a 27, so her total RR is 27 + 40 - 15x2 = 27 + 40 - 30 = 37, which is a failure of 76 - 37 = 39. To determine how many rounds she is confused, divide the amount of failure (39) by 5. Olamdiambo is confused for 8 rounds.

### 6. Equipment

The infinite variety of cultures, places, and situations found  in  role-playing  games  makes  it  impossible  to completely generalize economic systems and prices. Each world usually has one or more of its own coinage systems, with some based on the worth of the coins' component material or craftsmanship while others are tied to the society's faith in the coins' producer or guar -antor (e.g., the government backs its wooden nickels).

Obviously,  a  world  rich  in  varying  political  entities and cultural groups rarely relies on only one coinage system. Silver might be worth more than gold in cer -tain regions (although this would require considerable isolation  to  remain  stable),  while  other  locales  may value stone pieces or have no coinage at all. Barter, after all, is the norm in most places lacking a central authority.

<!-- image -->

| Table 6-0a: Coinage Standards             | Table 6-0a: Coinage Standards   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 gold piece (gp) =                       | 10 silver pieces                |
| 1 silver piece (sp) =                     | 10 bronze pieces                |
| 1 bronze piece (bp) = 1 copper piece (cp) | 10 copper pieces                |

Rolemaster uses  coins  of  different  values  (primarily silver, copper and bronze) that provide a comparative standard in order to regulate exchange, as shown in Table 6-0a. This helps people compare the values of their goods, even if they are simply trying to trade six ferret skins for a sheep hide. It also makes it easy to weave a localized jade-based economy into an impe -rial  system  that  embraces  silver  as  its  standard. The weight of individual coins can vary greatly with typ -ical  fantasy  coins  falling  between  1/10  and  ¼  of  an ounce (64 to 160 coins per pound).

Not all goods will be available in all settings, or even in all locations in a particular setting, and prices will also vary according to circumstances and the setting. The values given in the tables for cost and production time can vary depending on economy and technology. Similarly weight, overall size, and strength can vary depending on its construction and quality of materials. Expanded tables and rules for equipment can be found in Treasure Law .

Starting  characters  must  outfit  themselves  by  buy -ing equipment with some amount of starting money. Unless  given  other  equipment  by  the  Gamemaster, characters are assumed to begin only with appropriate clothing for the climate and their culture. A character's starting money depends on the setting (and possibly character background) and wealth category assigned by the Gam -emaster,  as  shown  in Table 6-0b.

The  equipment  listed is  assumed  to  be  of medium size. To deter -mine  cost  and  weight

<!-- image -->

| Table 6-0b:   | Starting Money   |
|---------------|------------------|
| Wealth        | Money            |
| Very Poor     | 2 sp/level       |
| Poor          | 10 sp/level      |
| Modest        | 20 sp/level      |
| Rich          | 30 sp/level      |
| Very Rich     | 50 sp/level      |

for items of different sizes (see Section 9.4) multiply the cost and weight by x4 for every size above medi -um (e.g., x4 for big, x16 for large, x64 for huge) and divide by 4 for every size below medium (e.g., ÷4 for small, ÷16 for tiny, ÷64 for diminutive).

#### 6.1. Breakage

Surprisingly, when you use a weapon to beat on things, it wears down and can break. When you use lock picks at some point one may break in the lock. Whenever a maneuver that uses any sort of equipment results in a roll of natural 33 or 77 (even if rolled on an open-end -ed roll), a breakage check must be made. Additionally, if a weapon or piece of equipment is used in a capacity

<!-- image -->

that it was not designed for, the GM may also call for a breakage check. Combat may also result in additional breakage checks due to fumble or critical results.

To check for breakage, a d100OE roll is made, add -ing in the item's strength due to design and materials, but subtracting any penalties incurred from previous breakage. Consult Table 6-1 to determine the result of the breakage roll. Breakage penalties apply to all uses of the item. For armor, the penalty applies as an armor maneuver penalty and if the total penalty exceeds -50, the area is no longer protected.

For  ammunition,  which  breaks  frequently,  a  single breakage roll is made for each type of ammo. Use the ammo column on Table 6-1 to determine the % of am -munition recovered.

##### Breaking Objects

Sometimes  characters  may  want  to  break  items  on purpose by punching or smashing them. Hitting items to  break  them  is  not  like  a  normal  attack  against  a living creature, and blows are assumed to hit automat -

ically. The item makes an immediate breakage check subtracting  the  character's  Strength  bonus  and  any additional  factors  the  GM  feels  should  apply  (e.g., breaking a flask with a hammer might be an additional -50 to the item's Strength).

Some objects may have incredibly high strengths of several hundred or more, such as a boulder or wall, and will obviously not break on the first attempt. In these cases  the  GM  must  determine  the  rate  at  which  the object's strength degrades due to damage. Normally a tool must be used which is stronger than the object to be broken; a steel axe is ideal when breaking through a  wooden  wall,  but  a  wooden  quarterstaff  will  not deal  any  damage  to  stone  construction. When  using a tool that is optimal for the task (e.g. a pickaxe for a stone wall), a reasonable guideline is that the object's strength is reduced by 20 per minute of effort. With an acceptable tool (e.g. a hammer for a stone wall), the strength is reduced by 10; with a poor tool (e.g. a sword for a stone wall) by 1-2 and the tool will need to make breakage checks itself. In non-tactical situa -tions this can be used to determine how long it takes to break the object (object strength is reduced to 0). In tactical situations, the object makes a breakage roll when its strength is reduced below 200 and another one every round that the strength is further reduced.

#### 6.2. Repairing Items

Equipment can be repaired with appropriate crafting skills  and  proper  materials  by  making  an  Absolute Maneuver and resolving using Table 6-2. The GM will determine a difficulty based on the materials and tools at hand. The damage penalty of the equipment applies to the repair maneuver roll. If the item is broken out -right, then a penalty of -100 applies.

Below  are  some  example  skills  used  for  repairing items, this is not an exhaustive list; any crafting skill appropriate to the item can be applied.

-  Leather-working: Leather armor and other items (e.g., leather parts of weapons, armor straps) given appropriate tools and raw materials.
-  Metal-working: Metal armor, shields, metal weaponry and other metal items can be repaired given appropriate facilities (i.e., forge).
-  Wood-working: Wood items, including weapon -ry, structures and other objects can be repaired with appropriate tools.

Table 6-2: Equipment Repair

Roll Result

&lt; 1 Absolute Failure

Due to your ineptitude, the item breaks. If it was already broken, then you make a huge mess and the item is unrepairable. And everyone laughs at you.

1 - 75 Failure

Despite, or perhaps because of, your efforts, the item remains broken or damaged. You are probably better off buying a new one, hope it wasn't sentimental.

UM 66 Unusual Event

You're a clever one (you think). You don't manage to repair the item exactly,  but  rather  jury-rig  it,  which  is  then  either  func -tional (Partial Success or higher) or completely non-functional (Failure  or  less).  Either  way  it  looks  makeshift  and  kind  of stupid.

76 - 100 Partial Success

Either your skill is lacking or your heart wasn't into it. A com -pletely broken item cannot be repaired, although any damage penalties may be reduced by half.

101 - 175 Success

A thorough, complete and solid piece of work. You completely repair a damaged item, or fix a broken item (with a permanent -10 penalty).

176 + Absolute Success

You  are  a  repair-wizard! You  manage  to  completely  repair  a damaged or broken item as good as new. Too bad your master -craft skills are not being used to make new unique works.

Weights given based on average human weight of 185 lbs.

The "Enc (%)" column is percentage of body weight used to calculate encumbrance (Section 5.4).

For piecemeal armor and called shots, head and limb armor is treated as the torso AT if the appropriate type (Light for AT 2-3, Medium 4-6, Heavy 7-10), otherwise use the AT in parentheses (AT 3, 5, or 9).

For details regarding maneuver, ranged, and perception penalties, see Section 7.2

### 7. Weapons &amp; Armor

Technology and science have advanced at least in part from research into the best materials to make both weap -ons for killing and armor for defense. From sharpened rocks and fire-hardened sticks, antler and ivory daggers, and stone maces to the advent of metal weapons, better materials allowed for better weapons, which in turn led to better armor to protect against them, which in turn led to better weapons to penetrate the armor…

Weapons of all shapes and sizes have been developed: axes,  picks,  blades,  devices  to  shoot  projectiles  and exotic multiple part weapons consisting of chains and spikes. Individual cultures, however, tend to rely on a few weapons that they know are effective and afford -able, or they simply rely on work tools, such as farm implements,  to  protect  themselves  when  needed.  For mercenaries and those more skilled in warfare, choos -ing a weapon is both a cultural and practical decision, as one factors in cost, weight, and effectiveness. Soldiers in some cultures get such decisions made for them, with weapons and armor issued by their superiors.

When dodging a blow simply was not enough, shields began to be used. When those proved inadequate, armor pieces  were  invented  that  covered  vulnerable  areas, such as greaves, braces, and helmets. Woven grass and tough woods, animal hides, treated and splinted, were all  used  in  various  cultures to make armor. Advances in  metallurgy  allowed  for  scale,  mail  and  brigandine armors  that  kept  armor  flexible  to  allow  the  warrior mobility and speed on the battlefield.

Rolemaster simulates weapons and armor by incorporating  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  different  types  of attacks (e.g., crushing, piercing) against different types of armor (e.g., rigid leather, mail). For instance, mail is very effective versus slashing attacks, but less so ver -sus piercing attacks. Even light armor is a boon against many weapons, although some types of attacks such as fire or electricity care little for the type of armor a foe has chosen. Those who choose to wear armor into bat -tle will have to weigh cost, maneuverability and overall protection.

impRovised weapons &amp; aRmoR

Players often need to use a mundane item as an improvised weapon (e.g., lengths of chain, cooking knives, firewood). When wishing to use a new weapon, use an existing chart and impose a penalty. If appropriate, also adjust the type of critical inflicted, the attack size, the Fumble Range, and Range Modifiers. If the combatant does not know the skill for that type of attack, the pen -alty for Similar Skills (Chapter 3: Skills) is applied as well.

Example: Somarl is unarmed and chased into the kitchen at the back of the inn; he looks around desperately for a weapon. The GM considers the items likely to be found and declares a kitchen knife should be considered a -15 small (-1 size) dagger. A length of firewood is a -30 club and a heavy iron soup ladle a -50 small (-1 size) mace. Somarl has +55 skill in hafted weapons, so he selects a likely piece of firewood and turns to face his pursuers. His effecti ve skill with the firewood will be 55 - 30 = +25.

#### 7.1. Weapons

The terms weapon and attack are used interchangeably, even  though  natural  attacks  and  spells  (e.g.,  martial arts, claws, fire bolt) are not weapons per se. Attacks are broken down into several groups, with each having a different Development Point cost. The attacks within each group correspond to skill specializations. Each attack has an attack table given in Chapter 10.

##### Melee Weapons

All weapons that are wielded in hand-to-hand combat are  melee  weapons,  from  swords  and  clubs  to  flails and pole axes. Melee weapons can be used to make attacks and defend against them (the latter is known as 'parrying'). Weapons are categorized according to how they are used. All melee weapon skills use St/St/ Ag for the stat bonuses.

All  two-handed  melee  weapons,  including  Greater Blade, Greater Chain, Greater Hafted, and Pole Arm are treated as one size larger as noted on the equipment lists. See Section 9.4 for details about attack sizes. In addition,  two-handed weapons gain a +10 bonus on their attack.

- Blade :  Some form of sharp edge with a handle or grip, sometimes with a usable point, suitable for one-handed use. Depending on the design, blades can  be  used  as  slashing  or  thrusting  weapons. Some blades, such as the broadsword and scimitar, are  suitable  primarily  for  slashing.  Short  blades like  daggers  and  short  swords  are  often  used  to thrust. The heavier arming sword is also well suit -ed for thrusting, including against armored foes. Some blades are designed to be good at either one. Broadsword, dagger, falchion, arming sword, rapier, scimitar, short sword
- Chain :  Chain  weapons are any one-handed weap -on that incorporates a chain connecting multiple pieces, often with weights, spikes or even blades attached. Flail
- Hafted :  Short  hafted  weapons  have  small  handles which usually end in a weight (hammers/maces) or blades (axes) to beat on opponents. Some may include spikes, knobs, or flanges to increase dam -age. Battle  axe,  club,  fighting  stick,  mace,  war -hammer
- Greater Blade : Depending on the design, two-hand -ed  blades  may  be  used  as  slashing  or  thrusting weapons. The longsword is, like the one-handed arming sword, designed to thrust  against  armor, while the long scimitar and claymore are best for slashing. Longsword, great falchion, long scimitar
- Greater Chain : These mighty chain linked weapons require two hands and are often fitted with heavy weights, spikes and other dangerous adornments. Heavy flail
- Greater  Hafted :  These  long  two-handed  hafted weapons rely on weight and may feature a slash -ing  or  stabbing  blade  perpendicular  to  the  haft (axes/picks) or a weight (maces/hammers). They are used for powerful strikes, although they lose some effectiveness  against  heavier  armor. Great mace, long axe, quarterstaff, war mattock
- Pole Arm : Pole arms include a variety of different weapons  (e.g.,  halberd,  bill  hook,  glaive)  that range from 6' to 12' or more in length. This allows them to be used to attack foes from a second rank,

behind allies.  Cover DB modifiers are halved for pole  arms,  so  pole  arm  attacks  from  the  second rank  typically  incur  a  +20  DB  modifier  (versus +40 DB for other melee weapons). Pole arms can also be braced against charges (Section 8.2). Halberd, glaive, poleaxe, spear (1H or 2H)

- Shield Bash :  Using shields defensively is detailed in Section 9.6, however shields can also be used as weapons. When using a shield to bash an op -ponent, it is  treated  as  a  weapon  in  all  respects, including the ability to parry. The combatant uses his Shield skill bonus as his OB. When a shield is being used to attack, it no longer offers any defen -sive benefits beyond the OB put into parry. Target, normal, full, wall
- Exotic : There are all manner of interesting weapons that are unusual in design and require techniques much different than any other weapon. For these weapons,  the  specialization  is  in  the  specific weapon. Net, whip

##### Natural Attacks

Unarmed  attacks  include  all  melee  attacks  made without the use of a weapon, such as punches, kicks, head butts, knees, elbows, etc. Natural attacks include everything  from  bites  and  claws  to  trampling  and stinging.  Some  creatures  may  have  natural  attacks that allow unrestricted parrying, using an armored or inert  body  part  (e.g.,  elephant  tusks  or  crab  claws). Similarly, unarmed combatants may use a small shield or  wear  bracers  or  greaves  in  order  to  parry  attacks

(Section 9.6). Natural attacks are treated as the same size as the character or creature (unless modified by a talent).

Unarmed and natural attacks are categorized accord -ing to the style of fighting or method of the attack. The first  three  (strikes,  sweeps  &amp;  throws,  and  wrestling) are  the  ones  most  often  used  by  humanoid  combat -ants  that  lack  natural  body  weaponry.  Many  natural and fantastic creatures have natural weaponry such as claws or horns.

- Strikes (Ag/St/St) : Unarmed attacks such as punches, kicks, elbows, knees, head-butts, and other striking attacks.
- Sweeps &amp; Throws (Ag/St/Ag) : Sweeps, trips, throws, and other such unbalancing attacks.
- Wrestling (Ag/St/Ag) : Grabbing and holding attacks.
- Beak (Ag/St/St) : Beaks, pinchers.
- Bite (Ag/St/St) : All types of bites, the most common natural attack.
- Claw (Ag/St/St) : Claws, talons.
- Horn (Ag/St/St) : Horns, tusks.
- Ram (Ag/St/Ag) : Ram, bash, butt, knockdown, slug.
- Stinger (Ag/St/Ag) : Small piercing stingers are often used to deliver poison, while larger ones stab deep to damage internal organs.
- Trample (Ag/St/St) : Trampling and stomping. Com -batants may only trample or stomp on those who are 2 or more sizes smaller than they are.

##### Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons include both those that are thrown (e.g., dagger or bola) and devices that propel missiles (e.g., bows or slings). Ranged attacks benefit from the fact  that  they  cannot  be  parried,  although  defenders benefit  from  shields  and  cover.  Vambraces  (armor worn on the arms) can restrict the attacker's freedom of movement and impose a penalty to all ranged at -tacks (see Table 6-4), so archers may choose to use lighter  arm  protection  that  impedes  ranged  attacks less.

A ranged attack is (usually) a single shot or missile. Ranged weapons cannot be parried, nor can they be used to parry. As the distance between an attacker and his target increases, ranged attacks become more dif -ficult. Each attack table that can be used at a distance indicates  the  ranges  for  Short  (+0),  Medium  (-10), Long (-25), Extremely Long (-50), and Absurd (-100). Some attacks have a point-blank bonus that is applied at ranges of 10' or less.

Ranged weapons are categorized according to the gen -eral  type  of  weapon. All ranged skills use Ag/Ag/St for the stat bonuses.

- Bow - Includes all types of hand-drawn bows. Bows require  two  hands  to  use. Short  bow,  composite bow, long bow
- Crossbow -  Light  and  hand  crossbows  can  be hand-spanned or cocked with a lever, while heavy crossbows use a winch, but most take a long time to  load.  Light  and  heavy  crossbows  require  two hands  to  use  effectively,  while  hand  crossbows require two hands to load and cock but only one to fire. Light crossbow, heavy crossbow, hand crossbow
- Sling - Slings can be difficult to learn but are capa -ble of much higher ranges than thrown weapons. Sling, sling-staff
- Thrown - Weapons that are thrown, with either one or two hands, have much shorter ranges than de -vices. Dagger, hand axe, bola, rock, javelin, spear
- Exotic - There are all manner of interesting weapons that are unusual in design and require techniques much different than any other weapon. For these weapons, skill is taken in the specific weapon and does not apply to any other weapon (except for the use of Similar Weapons). Blowpipe

#### 7.2. Armor

The types of armor in any particular setting may be many and varied, from quilted fabric or wood covering the torso to full suits of metal. The Armor Type (AT) of a combatant is based on the material and construc -tion of his armor and assumes a full suit, from head to toe. The Armor Types (from 1 to 10) do not represent only specific types of armor, but instead could be any of several different kinds of armor depending on the setting. Each AT shares similar characteristics with re -gard to flexibility, design and material. The flexibility and  material  factors  considered  are  summarized  on Table 7-2a. Descriptions of the 10 armor types, along with  man-made  and  natural  examples,  are  given  in Table 7-2b.

Wearing  armor  incurs  encumbrance  penalties  (due to weight) as well as armor maneuver penalties rep -resenting  the  confining  and  more  restrictive  nature of armor. Maneuver penalties apply to any maneuver that requires freedom of movement (e.g., running or climbing) but not Combat Training skills. Vambraces (arm protection) also give penalties to ranged weapon attacks, due to the weight of the armor on the arms, while helms also give penalties to perception due to their limited field of view and dampening of sounds.

| Flexibility                                   | Flexibility                                                       |
| Flexible                                      | All of the armor can move freely in any direction.                |
| Scale                                         | The armor is made of small, inflexible pieces.                    |
| Segmented                                     | The armor is made of large, inflexible pieces.                    |
| Plate                                         | The armor is largely inflexible, except at key joints.            |
| Material                                      | Material                                                          |
| Cloth                                         | Soft, porous material (e.g., cloth, fur)                          |
| Leather                                       | Tough, pliable, non-porous material (e.g., leather, thick skin)   |
| Horn                                          | Hard, non-porous materials (e.g., horn, cuir bouilli, bone, wood) |
| Metal                                         | Very hard, non-porous material (e.g., metal or glass)             |

As shown on Table 6-4 in Chapter 6 penalties are giv -en for complete suits, as well as the individual pieces if the Piecemeal Armor rules are used (see below). It is assumed that vambraces and greaves come in sets of two matching arms/legs. Maneuver penalties (only, not  ranged  or  perception  penalties  or  encumbrance penalties) from armor can be reduced with the Battle Expertise: Maneuvering in Armor skill.

If  armor  must  be  donned  quickly,  assume  it  takes one round per -5 maneuver penalty, and half that to remove. (Treat half a round as a 2 AP action.) It can be put on in half the time, but this will incur an addi -tional -20 maneuver penalty until the wearer takes the remaining time to properly adjust it.

Manufactured armor can be made better or worse than average. Superior materials, craftsmanship or design may offer a DB bonus, or be more maneuverable or lighter (reducing maneuver penalties). Likewise, infe -rior or damaged armor may have a DB penalty or may hinder movement more than usual.

Example: The mail found in the Duke's arming cabinet is  fine  high  steel  wire,  bent  into  tiny  links  in  a  tight, overlapping,  multilayered  pattern.  The  mail  hanging from a hook in the barbarian camp is crude rings of black iron wired together edge to edge to form a coat of mail. The Duke's mail is AT8 +10, while the barbarian's mail is AT8 -10.

Inherent  natural  armor  gives  no  maneuvering  pen -alties,  and  (usually)  provides  full  body  cover  (i.e., 'vambraces', 'greaves', and 'helm'), also at no pen -alty.  However,  as  it  is  not  an  inert  material,  it  does not provide the defense against spells that worn armor does (i.e.,  bonuses  to  Resistance  Rolls  do  not  apply from natural armor) or interfere with spellcasting.

Piecemeal Armor

A combatant is wearing piecemeal armor if he is not wearing a full suit of armor or is wearing mismatched armor (e.g., a mail shirt with heavy leg greaves). Ar -chers may forgo vambraces to improve their shots, while soldiers may choose to wear metal helms or greaves along with leather torso armor. Combatants may  also  wear  piecemeal  armor  through  necessity (loss of a piece of armor, limited funds, etc.).

When an attack is made against a combatant wearing piecemeal  armor,  roll  the  critical  at  the  same  time as the attack roll. Use the critical roll to determine the area struck and then determine the attack results based on the Armor Type for that location.

Torso  armor  is  assigned  an  Armor  Type  but  head and limb protection is described as light, medium, or heavy. If the head or limb protection is appropriate for  the  torso  armor  type,  use  the  same AT  for  that location as the torso. Light armor is appropriate for AT 2-3,  Medium  for AT  4-6,  and  Heavy  for  7-10. Otherwise, treat Light armor as AT 3, Medium as AT 5, and Heavy as AT 9.

| 1                        | None                            | Those without armor have great incentive to not be hit at all, since there is nothing protecting them from the weapon.                                                                                                                                    | Light clothing                                                                      | Humans, birds, amphibians, snakes, fish                                            |
| 2                        | Heavy Cloth (Flexible Cloth)    | Heavy clothes, hides, and furs are mostly used to protect against the elements al - though they do well at protecting against light slashes and provide some padding against crushing attacks.                                                            | Heavy clothing, furs, armor under-padding (haketon, arming coat), padded armor      | Light hides or animals with significant fur                                        |
| 3                        | Soft Leather (Flexible Leather) | Flexible like clothing, the soft leather Ar - mor Type is a heavier and thicker version of hides and furs and frequently used as the under-padding for heavier armors. It provides similar, but better protection, than heavy clothing.                   | Thick leather clothing, heavy armor under-pad - ding, quilted armor (gambeson)      | Heavy hide and/or thick heavy fur over hide, thin blubber, soft carapace           |
| 4                        | Hide Scale (Scale Horn)         | Hide Scale armors consist of small hard horn-like elements sewn together or to a flexible backing. Scaled Hide provides moderate protection against slashing attacks, although piercing weapons can more easily penetrate in between elements and joints. | Persian Imperial archer armor                                                       | Alligator hide, chitin carapace, pangolin                                          |
| 5                        | Laminar (Segmented Horn)        | Improved but similar protection toAT 4, Laminar consists of larger than hand sized horn-like elements connected together or overlapping in flexible joints.                                                                                               | Light samurai armor                                                                 | Armadillo, overlapping rings of giant worm                                         |
| 6                        | Rigid Leather (Plate Horn)      | The best protection organic armor can provide,AT 6 is made up of large rigid plates and provides good protection vs. all types of attacks. It is light but not as strong as metal.                                                                        | Cuir bouilli plate, Linothorax                                                      | Armored hides like rhinos, shell of a crab or armadillo, very thick blubber        |
| 7                        | Metal Scale (Scale Metal)       | Metal Scale is made up of small metal elements linked together, usually on a flexible backing. It provides very strong protection vs. piercing, strong vs. slashing, and less vs. crushing.                                                               | Lorica Squamata, Ringmail, Japanese kikko, jazerant, Chinese mountain pattern armor | Enchanted creatures with scaled hide as hard as metal                              |
| 8                        | Mail (Flexible Metal)           | Mail is flexible and more maneuverable than other metal armors and provides excellent protection vs. slashing attacks, although piercing attacks can more easily penetrate it. It provides marginal protection vs. crushing attacks.                      | Maille, Viking mail-shirt (byrnie), Roman lorica hamata, Norman hauberk             | Enchanted creatures with metallic or metal-hard fur                                |
| 9                        | Brigandine (Segmented Metal)    | Brigandine armor, often called splinted, is made up of larger than hand sized metal plates. It provides most of the benefits of plate, without solid back and breastplate, therefore weaker vs. crushing and piercing attacks but much easier to wear.    | Roman lorica segmenta- ta, metal samurai armors                                     | Enchanted creatures with overlapping bands, large scales or rings as hard as metal |
| 10                       | Plate (Plate Metal)             | Plate consists of larger metal plates cen- tered on either a single torso barrel, or a pair of back and breast plates attached at the sides. Usually overlapping at the joints, it provides the best protection vs. all physical attacks.                 | Plate                                                                               | Enchanted creatures with shells as hard as metal                                   |

##### Care and feeding of your armor and weapons:

'What'cha mean you can't fix it?'

Bremgor replies, 'I can't just scrape the rust off a blade! You should have been oiling and sharpening your blade, Forgar.'

'Both armor and weapons need care and maintenance. Metals need to be oiled, especially when in moist climates. Blades should be sharpened with a whetstone on a regular basis. Even leather needs to be oiled occasionally, and I don't know leather from my neighbor's evil cat!' Then thinks to himself, Maybe I need to oil my neighbor's cat and throw him into the forge, then maybe it will stop lurking around.

Then Bremgor continues, 'How did it end up so bad anways?'

'T'was a rough trip,' Forger starts to explain, 'A mage paid me to escort him on a trip through the badlands to the south. But you know how them mages are, can't trust them. He somehow opened a portal to some jungle-like land, or maybe it was some kinda other dimensional thing. But we was trudgin' through rain soaked lands of thick underbrush an swamps, an fought some nasty critters with acidic blood.'

Bremgor nods his head, 'But had you been oiling the blade every couple of days and after use, and of course wiped it off and oiled it again after fighting the creatures with acidic blood, then it might have been salvageable or at least no where near as bad. But now it is too corroded for me to be able to do much with it.'

Forgar replies, 'But can't you just heat it up and hammer the rust off'n it?'

'It is not that easy, man,' Bremgor retorts. 'Would be better off to reforge the entire thing, which is going to cost you nearly as much as a new weapon. But if that is what you want, I guess I can do so.'

'That much?'

'Yes, and next time take care of your stuff better, otherwise you might as well hire a full time weaponsmith. Someone other than me. Maybe an apprentice, since you don't need quality if it is going to be re-forged every couple of weeks. Then you would not even need to sharpen it.'

##### The Black Reaver

As told by personal testimony of Brand the Mage, vol. 9 chapter 22 of The Entity Record, by Elenmel, Historian, Scribe, and Astrologer.

'We had been doing all right. The map was true; we found the cave and the staircase. We made it across a floor filled with bones, fought the inevitable 'things', took some gold, and were proceeding, content with the success of our mission. We finally came to the temple level, knowing there wasn't much more to be done, when that stupid halfling... Well, Godfrey, our fighter, a pretty tough Dwarf had warned us about burglars, saying that you can't trust them even if they're on your side. I have to admit, I was the one who was so sure that we needed Kraeco if the thing was going to get done. But right now I can't remember if there was a single thing he did that we couldn't have done some other way.

Anyway, he couldn't leave well enough alone. We were already rich, and stood close to the goal of our search. But there was this jewel, a bauble really, fastened onto some kind of cup sitting on a table in the dead center of the room. Kraeco snatched it as he went by, looking the other way. No sooner had the cup left the table when I heard a sound like nothing I have ever heard before. You see, there was a large metal door on the north wall, steel I think, or at least iron. There was a loud clang and I saw the head of an axe sticking through the door from the inside. Then just like ripping canvas, the blade slid all the way to the floor and that door, that steel door, fell in two pieces on the floor.

Standing there, framed by the door was... How can I describe it? He was about  8  feet  tall,  shaped  like  a  man,  but  black.  His  armor,  his  cloak,  his gloves, even the emptiness inside the helmet were darker than the soil of the Pale. The only other colors I could see were the glow of his eyes, the shine of his axe blade, and the silver of his helmet with the horns curved down. Then he began to walk towards Kraeco. The sound of his steps I recall in nightmares night after night: click, click, click - steadily walking on those tile floors, without hurry, without stopping. We ran. We ran like the gates of the Void had opened behind us. We fled into the open hall on the east side, opposite the way we had come in. It was a long worked hall, with the same tile floor. We ran until we came to the edge. You see, we were on the topside of a nearly vertical drop, about a hundred feet above the floor. There was an incredibly  large  Cyclops  sleeping  on  the  floor,  his  snoring  echoing  in  the cavern. I guess he was at least 50 feet tall.

I thought we had it made. There was a man-size opening on the floor of the cavern on the opposite side from where we were about 300 feet away. The clicking footsteps were steadily ringing closer behind us. I figured it would be great to get an angry Cyclops between us and him. So I told Hogan to use his ring, the one with the white eagle on it. It makes a big bird you can ride, so we got on it and rode down across the cave to that hole and the bird disappeared. I remember just as we left the cliff top I could see the thing coming down the hall: click, click, click - his boots ringing on that tile, and his eyes glowing a bright red from within the darkness.

Well, I fired a firebolt and got the Cyclops awake, and Dorien threw an illu -sion to get him turned around the other way, facing the thing. The next thing I saw is the stuff of every bad dream. Our enemy came to the edge of the top of the cliff, lifted his big axe over his head with both hands and then fell forward off the cliff, head down. But he didn't fall - he glided, and landed on the floor in front of that huge cyclops: click, click, click. That stupid Cyclops! I feel so sorry for him now, even a little guilty. He had no idea what he was getting into when he reached down and grabbed him.

We, of course, ran. We were getting so that we considered that normal and natural now. The hallway, as the others, was tiled. We ran about 1000' until we came into a large round room filled with bones. And sure enough, we had to fight, and fight we did. But over the clattering noise in our own room I had the distinct feeling that I was hearing great screams from the way we had come. And when I started to think that the bellows might be the way a Cyclops in agony would yell. I made myself shut the din out of my mind.

Before too long, our battle was over and Kraeco and Godfrey began picking up gold. Then I heard it again: click, click, click. Hard-soled boots ringing on a tile floor. I created a great mass of rock and stone in the hall entrance into our room - it completely filled the doorway. But I was really scared by now so I was not satisfied yet. I did it three more times, layer after layer of solid stone, sealing up that entrance. I heard the clicking proceed to the stone blockage and then stop. There was a blissful silence. We fell on the floor, laughing in our relief.

Then, unbelieving, we heard a new sound, a loud clanging sound. Rhythmic, striking once about every 5 seconds: clang ... clang ... clang ...It was the kind of sound you would expect from someone banging on a boulder with an axe. When I suddenly realized the monster was swinging that axe at the stone I  came unglued! I'm not even sure what happened next, but I think we all panicked, running and hollering down the exit hall on the other side of our bone room. And just before we exited the hall into the bright sunlight of day I distinctly heard my stone wall ring, then crack, then crumble onto the floor. And then the weird sound again: click, click, click: our enemy, unhurried, walking down the hall.

We managed to get into our little ship and the hands cast us off before he came out of the cave. He walked towards us as our ship sailed from the is -land. When he came to the water's edge he kept right on walking, and I saw him walk into the sea, until he disappeared, the waters over his head.

Fortunately, I thought, the wind was strong with us, and we left the island quickly behind. Of course, I put some extra wind in the sail, trying with all my self-control not to gibber and cry from the horror I had just felt. But we sailed hard for about three days in good sailing weather and we were far into the open sea when we finally got caught in a storm. The storm lasted for four days. It was so severe we threw out all four sea anchors to try to hold our position against the southwest winds. We ate not at all, and slept very little. But the end came for Kraeco while I was sleeping at twilight. The rain had stopped, and the sounds of the ship and the wind made me delay too long when I heard the uncanny rhythmic sound of boots on the deck above me: click, click, click. When I finally realized that the nightmare was here, I woke with great suddeness and almost flew up the steps. I was in time to see a struggle, if you can call it that, which lasted probably only 20 seconds or so. Godfrey had charged the monster and the flat of the axe had flung him like a toy fully across the long grain of the deck. In all my years with Godfrey I had never seen him smitten unconscious with a single blow until then.

Kraeco,  of  course,  was  terrified.  He  squealed  and  fled  from  the  creature; mighty Hogan interposed himself in the creature's path. That was Hogan's last heroic act. The axe swung, clove through the magical armor Hogan had laboured for, severed his shield from edge to edge, and Hogan himself fell in two pieces on the deck, his life's blood everywhere. Before the thing finally caught Kraeco, I had thrown vacuums and death clouds, and Dorien, finally arriving, was also blasting him with spell after spell.

He walked through those clouds and those bursts of light and through the bolts and balls not slowing in the least in his click, click, click. I do not know to this day if anything we did against him even made him notice we were there. When he grabbed Kraeco, the poor little burglar stabbed at him several times with his magical short sword, and finally the blade broke on the mon -ster's armor. At that moment, I think Kraeco must have fainted for he hung limp in the monster's arms and the hilt of his little sword skittered across the deck. The last I remember, the black cloaked figure walked through the upper deck wall, splintering into pieces. As I began to pass out myself, all I knew were the sounds of the click, click, click, of his boots, and then the splash as he walked back into the sea. I've never seen him again face to face, but I see him often in the heart of my worst dreams.'

Introduction from the personal testimony of Brand the Mage, vol. 1 preface of The Entity Record, by Elenmel, Historian, Scribe, and Astrologer.

'There is an infinite number of beings in this world, or should I say, in these worlds. I have beheld much more than my share as I stumbled time after time onto the ethereal plains. Creatures of power that you can't measure or imagine. Creatures of beauty, both sublime and horrible. Creatures of awe, which I have seen paralyze the greatest lords with fear. Creatures friendly, unfortunately rare, who can rescue you from almost any terrible thing, as they follow either their whims or their designs (I know not which). Crea -tures chaotically assembled, with mixed and bizarre forms, and some with no forms at all. Creatures without end, having every level of power and every conceivable shape of body and mind. I have already begun to think that as the stars which glimmer over all the plains number more than the grains of sand, so also the number of creatures is infinite.'
